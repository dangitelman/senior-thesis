WarrenBuffetsSon,"Official Boeing announcement


As we have emphasized, the FAA and other global regulators will determine when the 737 MAX returns to service. However, in order to help our customers and suppliers plan their operations, we periodically provide them with our best estimate of when regulators will begin to authorize the ungrounding of the 737 MAX.

We are informing our customers and suppliers that we are currently estimating that the ungrounding of the 737 MAX will begin during mid-2020. This updated estimate is informed by our experience to date with the certification process. It is subject to our ongoing attempts to address known schedule risks and further developments that may arise in connection with the certification process. It also accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review of the 737 MAX's flight control system and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board process which determines pilot training requirements.

Returning the MAX safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen. We acknowledge and regret the continued difficulties that the grounding of the 737 MAX has presented to our customers, our regulators, our suppliers, and the flying public. We will provide additional information about our efforts to safely return the 737 MAX to service in connection with our quarterly financial disclosures next week.

I think the Chinese flu and reporting record are sparking really bad memories, but health care improvements with a milder disease makes me think that’s an overreaction. A panic sell off on HSI and issues in HK... what else is new, and it’s the Chinese New Year. 

Earnings season is on, not-QE is still on, the US market is the best place in all of the world’s markets to park money, and QQQ is the index with the most growth potential. I expect that while there will be ups and downs, macro risk is the only really big one right now.

I left cash gang and bought 20x 2/21 QQQ 225 calls at $2.98 this morning. I left some money on the table by watching for a bottom - I at least didn’t buy into an instant bull trap. </p>

<p>I think the Chinese flu and reporting record are sparking really bad memories, but health care improvements with a milder disease makes me think that’s an overreaction. A panic sell off on HSI and issues in HK... what else is new, and it’s the Chinese New Year. </p>

<p>Earnings season is on, not-QE is still on, the US market is the best place in all of the world’s markets to park money, and QQQ is the index with the most growth potential.

WikiTextBot,"**Problem gambling**

Problem gambling is an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler's behaviour. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common disorder that is associated with both social and family costs.

WikiTextBot,"**Trading halt**

A trading halt occurs in the U.S. when a stock exchange stops trading on a specific security for a certain time period. The halt, which can happen a few times a day per security if FINRA deems it, usually lasts for one hour, but is not limited to that. Trading halts can happen any time of day. The listed company is supposed to call the exchange where it is listed, 10 minutes prior to any material news that they are releasing, in order for the exchange to halt the stock before the news is released.

johntaylor37,"Depends on your assumptions. It’s great for a small positive move. Besides reduced leverage, my big issue with DITM contracts is if the underlying experiences a big pullback you’ll lose quite a bit of value. With a single ATM contract, you get *most* of the same upside exposure with a lot less downside risk and a lot less capital tied up. Play with the dates and you can hedge risk using theta instead of delta.

If for a specific case 2x ATM contracts are cheaper than 1x DITM contract, the ATM contracts are likely to outperform for anything but a very small move while offering a lower risk for a black swan event. Or 2x long dated ATM calls vs. 1x DITM call with equivalent delta exposure, do you want more time in the market or to close faster...","<div class=""md""><p>Depends on your assumptions.
