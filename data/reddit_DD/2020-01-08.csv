SpursFan4Life21,Kind of a crazy idea but do you think Trump is playing the system to help “others” benefit on Wall Street from his comments and actions.   He’s been playing this whole China trade deal and what he says swings the market up and down.  Imagine if you knew that and had millions to bet on the SPY before and after his actions.  People have made millions if not billions on his comments alone. All with little to no real action (where is the trade deal?).  Now with Iran put your money on oil and today make sure you sell before he speaks.   I’ve never seen one person who can manipulate the system as much as him.  Thoughts?,"<div class=""md""><p>Kind of a crazy idea but do you think Trump is playing the system to help “others” benefit on Wall Street from his comments and actions.

moose8106,"Serious question for a minute:

This T Call credit spread I sold yesterday. 
Sold 1/10 39c
Bought 1/10 39.5c

I didn't realize till after the fact that ex-div date is 1/9 (tomorrow) (ugh). Dividend is .53 - what's the rule of thumb? If the 39c is ITM at the end of the day and the price of the 1/10 39p is less than .53 , then the short calls will likely be exercised? 

Trying to see if I should bite the loss and close out now. Current price is $39.37 - or wait, if the call holder wanted in on the dividend, would they have had to exercise the calls last night? Wouldn't the shares need to be settled *prior* to the ex-div date?","<div class=""md""><p>Serious question for a minute:</p>

It’s more profitable with better premiums, and can be safer depending on when and where you set strikes, and it’s probably what r/options would recommend, but it’s a lot of money to have tied up if you’re doing credit spreads. Covered calls is a different story. If you’ve got shares, it’s not as imperative of a timeline though thats not what you’re inquiring about since you included puts. 

So no, not stupid. Just gotta watch it closely over those days because to make any decent profit you’re going to have to time a strike well, hope we bounce off that and flounder. If you sell puts today exp fri at a strike of 310$ you’re gonna net about $3 in premium and set aside $100. 323 in either direction? Well, pick right and you’ve got an alright sum to have just let sit till Friday.

Haunting-Independent,"Yes I totally think so.  I watched a CNBC interview of an options trader that kept seeing very large bets on S and P 500 futures that were abnormal to everyone on the trading floor.  It was 3 or 4 huge bets the last 5 months of 2019.  Like 200k contracts of futures.  He said the trades didn’t make sense and were relatively in line with the market moves after Trump made a tweet that affected the stock market.  If you did the math those single trades would net over $1 bil each.  And the trades would open and close in a matter of days.  

Trump probably just tips someone off that he’s going to make a tweet which will for sure move the stock market.  Although this only works if Trump tweets have the adverse effect on the stock market that the options trader with inside info is betting on.  *takes tin hat off*.  

Could just be coincidence but Trump seems like someone that doesn’t give a shit about using his power to make $$$ lol","<div class=""md""><p>Yes I totally think so.

Pylyp23,"I came to that realization after the attack on the largest oil producing facilities in the world last year did absolutely nothing to the markets. The Goldman Sachs report a couple weeks ago that said the markets might be ""recession proof"" is meme worthy but also has some good points that relate to this topic in that our current markets are incredibly well shielded to various major event categories even compared to 10 or 20 years ago. I'm not some bull gang spammer either. I don't think it will always go up and I'm sure a correction is coming someday but the market is constantly changing and evolving and we need to keep that in mind when trying to judge current performance by past trends.   


In the next century we will see interplanetary commerce develop as well as resource extraction from bodies within the solar system. By 2100 companies with trillion dollar market caps will be commonplace and there will be caches of wealth unimaginable by today's standards. Barring a complete societal collapse there is no ceiling so I'm definitely long term bullish on this shit.","<div class=""md""><p>I came to that realization after the attack on the largest oil producing facilities in the world last year did absolutely nothing to the markets.

freehouse_throwaway,"if its gonna be painful, take your principal out now by selling enough to cover it.

while we're chatting its already retracting. that's like 10k less from 498 earlier. 

honestly waiting for $500 vs $498 which it was at earlier didnt make sense given the risk involved (you're waiting for like 2.6k more). you're literally at the highest point this stock has ever been in its lifespan. (to be fair, that was yesterday too)

anyways its your contracts bro but if this is a significant amount to you then i'd start taking some profit before EOD.

if you dont want to miss out on further gains rest of week (maybe TSLA goes nuts and do another 5% day). just put like a few K into some really wacky OTM shit for Feb/March. results will be pretty similar","<div class=""md""><p>if its gonna be painful, take your principal out now by selling enough to cover it.</p>
