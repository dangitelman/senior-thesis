sixplaysforadollar,"I think about going to yolo a little bit and get June calls of Amarin.  This stock has just repeatedly let everyone down because they cannot escape the thumb of patent litigation regarding their drug Vascepa and generics due to the drugs potential market being billions. 



They've settled with TEVA a couple months ago,. but a few other pharmas are still fighting, court ended January and the judge will make a written ruling EO March. 


Obviously, based on that, its still a gamble. After more reading, AMRN upped their sales force, and they have an earnings call next week or two i believe. 



I have 3 contracts each right now April and June. 23C and 25C respectively.

I was too busy taking a Finance test on which I did poorly because I'm feverish from the flu which I recently contracted when my toddler threw up all over me, twice. There are no makeup tests so I couldn't take a sick day. A laptop is required to take the test so I bring my janky ass laptop from the 00s to class. It decides to disconnect from WiFi a quarter of the way through the test and won't let me reconnect without closing the test window (and failing). The prof takes pity and gives me a loaner laptop. That one won't connect to the test either. Finally he gives me a paper test which I then had to complete in half the time. Me and everyone in my house has the flu and is vomiting and liquid shitting all day long. The test questions just pissed me off. Questions about mortgages just reminded me I have to rent. Questions about future value of investments assuming 10% gains each year... bitch I don't have any gains. Questions about how much should the parents set aside each year for their child's college or to buy them a car... bitch my parents owe ME money. Everywhere I look in this classroom are 19 year old hotties in yoga pants meanwhile me & the wife haven't had uninterrupted sex in weeks it's like a goddamn covert operation to not wake the kids. And my mid thirties prematurely graying broke ass will be lucky to earn my CPA by age 40 at this rate.","<div class=""md""><p>Fuck today seriously.

,"haha no problem. I traded CFDs for a bit when I first started out and wish someone would've just given me an honest overview then. Basically I noticed while trading CFDs that my stop was hit on the CFD when the future price never touched the level. Thee CFD is a contract that trades alone and is not pegged to the underlying's price. Given that a lot of sketchy as hell brokers offer CFDs there is a lot of room for getting screwed. Always only trade proper exchange traded products. Sign up for Interactive brokers, they allow almost anyone in the world to trade, only takes $2000 USD you can hook up proper futures and options. Then you can trade options on SPY for stupid cheap, options on ES (sp500 future), ES itself, or MES (micro ES contract)","<div class=""md""><p>haha no problem.

 It's good if you like regularly keeping it clean down there but by regularly I mean fukkin wEEKly. Any later and your hair just grows too long for it to be effective at all and like I said in my previous comment, you gotta trim it down a bit to help the product out cuz it ain't designed to weaken forests.","<div class=""md""><p>Naw it&#39;s def not that strong altho you probs don&#39;t wanna inhale it.

very_smarter,"Ex date you can sell your shares on this date (tomorrow, feb 19) and you will still be entitled to receive a dividend payment even though you won’t hold the stock anymore. 

The payment date is when you actually receive your dividend yield per share of whatever stock you sold on OR after ex date. 

If you sold MSFT shares today for instance, you would NOT make tomorrow’s ex date and be entitled to the aforementioned divy. 

Stable companies have their ex and payment dates on a typically stable schedule so they are incredibly priced in. Sometimes investors will purchase stock in a high div yield prior to ex date and then sell as soon as they can claim their future div - this happens often with high div yield stocks with poor pricing, which can cause a significant dip in price (usually short term). However, MSFT is a powerhouse stock and no one is thinking “oh boy finally I can get my dividend and get out of this awful stock”

I expect a small if not virtually insignificant dip for those who were only holding for the div ex- and then a return to normality and/or green.

Yeah haha I moved on from this ages ago. Full story was I dumped all my longs in early March as the shit hit the fan and went all in on UVXY (wish I could say I bottom-ticked it but obvs just got a middle of the move)

Long story short, I went from down ~15% to up about 150%. I then widdled that down quickly to ~120%, then a slow bleed down another 10% or so since I tried to call the top around 2900. Recently I took that off, shorted vol for a lucky two days, and am back fully betting on a leg down
