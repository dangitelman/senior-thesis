**India** up 0.5% 

**Hangseng** up 0.99% 

**Nikkei** up  0.72%

**Dow** futures (25,679.0) -80.0(-0.31%)

Global markets are in general trading in a range determined by the past weeks action but respecting their support and bouncing back along with breaking short term resistance makes it bullish overall, test of upward resistance makes a zone of no trade, trade will be triggered on rejection or break on resistance

e.g. go to r/investing, r/economy, etc and ask about what USD/stocks/bonds/etc might do over the next few months and you may hear exactly what you'd expect to hear from the extremes; well-studied vs complete fucking morons.  The well-studied are showing themselves wronger-n-a-muhfukuh in this market and the morons are either lucky / unlucky.

But, *but* the actual answers to shit seems to be found on WSB more often than other places..the trick is learning how to parse things and figure that out.

""No, I mean Quarter 2. I told him I could pump it until then, and I did."" I look at his tired body. Paper cuts, ink stained hands, ever-graying hair.

""You really think you're free?"" He hesitates. I can smell his fear. He didn't anticipate this question.

""What do you mean?""

""Well, the election isn't until November."" I can feel his tired mind churning, thinking about the late nights to come, and if he can survive.

""He wouldn't. He promised I could stop now.""

""He would. His promises mean nothing. You're the only hope he has left. And he knows that.""

This number also does not account for those who have also exhausted benefits or are still waiting to be approved.

Then you have to account for all the jobs who will never come back. Albeit through permanent closure of their company, or larger corps doing away with those jobs as a means of reducing expenditures. Then there are the jobs that will be considered redundant or nonessential.

I go back to redeem my cash. Turns out I won the 2:30 drawing although I definitely left closer to 3. The paperwork has my picture on it taken through a security camera.

UserZwei,So let me get this straight. The gift tax is complete bullshit? Yes they have 15k limit for the year but even if you give more the additional amount is debited from your lifetime gift tax of 11.4 million set by the IRS. So you as the give do not even pay gift tax until your total gifts exceed 11.4 million. And the receiver never pays gift tax. Is this correct? Any CPA’s here?,"<div class=""md""><p>So let me get this straight. The gift tax is complete bullshit?

Revolant742,"What we are hoping happens has never been accomplished in human history. Even if a vaccine is created soon , we face a few crucial issues with getting it to the population. The news alone would cause markets to soar sure, but it might not be sustainable. Here is why. 

1. Nationalism. Whoever wins the vaccine race will keep the vaccine for its people alone first. Which is why multiple vaccines likely have to get made not just one. Getting one country vaccinated will take time and it delays the rest of the world potentially.

2. Supply and demand. A billion or more vaccines won't be manufactured very quickly. Also what will they cost? A lot of the growing permanently unemployed won't be able to afford much. Herd immunity will be costly and many Americans will refuse vaccinations because you can bet just like masks it will be politicized for no reason. It already is.

Once the multiple vaccines are found and tested, and maaaaybe ready for distribution we will probably be in Spring 2021, and then good luck administering it. Typically it takes five years to fully eradicate a pandemic through herd immunity even with vaccine development unless the virus dissapears.

Meanwhile, Covid could just mutate and we start all over. It already mutated to become more contagious once.

So don't bet on Q3-Q4 or even 2021 Q1 being substantially better. Long plays are looking worse and worse for any ""recovery"" sector stock. Companies like AMC, AAL, HTZ likely actually won't survive.

TaylorJettison,"Hello! 

I have had this quote in my mind for awhile now..

“Those who are not grateful for their beautiful life deserve a painful death.” 

I’m really starting to believe it with all these rich people in America people pretending to be “oppressed” because they can’t drive drunk on public streets and use counterfeit money.. meanwhile people in Yemen are starving to death. 

Can someone help me grow up? Inherently this thinking feels wrong and selfish but I can’t break it. I’ve always felt so lucky just to be American, everything feels like a gift. I’d rather be homeless in LA than the richest man in Syria. Segregating people’s adversity seems problematic in itself..

Its at 40 now and I want to sell covered call weekly since I cant get shit selling at 50 should I buy 2 to 3 months out OTM calls with a total delta of 100 then sell weeklies at 42?

justin_time_4_life,"How can I buy options for a company on the TSX?  Specifically $DCBO. 


$DCBO
IPO’d in September last year at $16. At $34 now. 

I built and managed one of their sales teams two years thru IPO.  They’re the #1 competitor to $CSOD and a few dozen other legacy learning technology platforms.

CSOD is diversified as an HCM vs docebo which is a pure LMS (total learning solution), but if you read Glassdoor reviews for CSOD, peep what their engineers are saying about the platform vs docebo. 

They’re the legit unicorn of the $20B  LMS industry  (SaaS corporate learning)

Likely will get acquired by AMZN, WDAY, or CRM before the 3 year lockout expires.

Fact: we were demoing the platform to 20~ AWS execs in Vegas. It was web casted back to leadership at HQ. 
Bezos was on the demo. This was before the IPO but after the announcement. They made an unsolicited offer to buy us for $120M. We said “nah, dawg, not yet”","<div class=""md""><p>How can I buy options for a company on the TSX?  Specifically $DCBO. </p>

hk808,"No - the only explanation for this is one of two things. The fed is either selling assets, or they’re not reinvesting in maturing securities. It’s not as simple as crying about gold and inflation.

If the Fed were selling their assets, that would impact the bond market - sending interest rates naturally higher.

But since interest rates are not moving higher, it’s more likely the fed isn’t reinvesting maturing securities, which automatically decreases their balance sheet. Maturity terms on the Fed repo schedule state 28 days, so we could see similar decreases in their balance sheet month over month.

Think of it like letting options expire worthless, only it’s the Fed and they can just print more money. So they can just keep YOLOing and losing money - to the benefit of the American economy.","<div class=""md""><p>No - the only explanation for this is one of two things.

TJwhosurmomma,"Any Vet who denies care to an animal who’s in dire need of it because they’re “too busy” is nothing more than a flesh sack full of scum. Fuck them. I’m sorry for your loss bro, losing a pet is a horrible thing especially one that’s that young. At least you can take solace in the fact that you were there for him in his final moments. Many people don’t want to be there for their pets last breaths because it’s too hard. Unfortunately it’s even harder on the pet who can’t even comprehend what’s going on. When my last dog had to get put to sleep (she was very old and very sick) my whole family stayed in the room and pet her until it was over. It at least gives them the comfort of the people they love until it’s over.","<div class=""md""><p>Any Vet who denies care to an animal who’s in dire need of it because they’re “too busy” is nothing more than a flesh sack full of scum.

Also the big fucking obvious answer is that a lot of these cases are BRAND NEW. Yes there was an increase since May but we dont know how much was due to testing capacity. Now that its clear that hospitalizations are increasing, you can expect deaths to increase with time as well.

Sciencetist,"I never got the hate people had for Holden. He's childish, but he really doesn't deserve the dismissiveness from the other characters in the book. I always remember that conversation he has with the taxi driver about where the ducks go in the winter.

edit: and Catcher in the Rye is easily better than any video game story.

CombodianBreastMilk,"The Beckman-Coulter test is actually better.  I'm a clinical lab consultant and was running a clinical lab until May.  I'm getting a PhD now so I work at a huge research hospital.  My PI is also the clinical lab director for that hospital system.  

I had to evaluate these tests in April.  Virology testing isn't my area of expertise, but I had to catch up real quick and the more we looked at the Abbot test, the less we liked it.  We eliminated their test in probably our 2nd meeting because their quality was so poor.  The reason why 5-8 days is the typical turnaround time for those results has to do with the test quality.  I'm guessing that Abbot test was probably a finger prick and they stick the collection cartridge in a little toaster lookin thing.  They can run that test in about 5-10 minutes but can only do 1 or 2 at a time.  There is almost no sample clean up.  They have a high false negative rate.  It does not scale because of the hardware.  

The more accurate tests have a lot more sample clean up and a lot better sensitivity. They also take longer to run, depending on the testing technology.   They batch 96 or 384 samples together.  You get higher throughput but can't really report results without several layers of expert review. 

I talk with lab directors and obviously we talk about this shit since it is the biggest thing happening in the labs right now.  The Abbot test is actual garbage and has way too many false negatives.  I think the difference in the test is the protein the fluorescing molecule binds to.  Abbot and I think Siemens are testing for the same fragment.  The Beckman-Coulter test binds a different, more abundant covid protein.  Most hospitals are using multiple tests due to how critical this is and how fragile reagent supply chains are, especially back in March and April.  The 2 main hospital systems in my area are both mostly using the Beckman-Coulter tests at this time because it performs much better than Abbot. In May, they were using more Abbot tests because it was ready first. 

I have ABT shares in one account, but ABT isn't going to see substantial revenue increases because of this.  They will actually be lucky if the CV19 test kit revenue makes up for all the other testing kit and instrument revenue they are losing this year due to covid.

TLDR Don't buy leaps on ABT because you had a pleasurable testing experience.

RollingD,"I agree and disagree.  The Fed’s actions have been to alleviate and prevent liquidity issues within the market.  Uncertainty was a factor in the crash, but I think it had more to do with the trouble under the hood in financial markets.  People were freaked out about another financial crisis and started dumping everything when they thought the liquidity was going to disappear again.  Now that the Fed has made it abundantly clear there will never be a liquidity crisis again, the only way we can crash is if people lose faith in the system.  As more businesses close and go bankrupt it will eventually become apparent that our economy is quite fucked.  I think even lockdowns won’t necessarily spook the market into a selloff, but if BA or GE declares bankruptcy or some other big cap...yeah that might make the market bleed.","<div class=""md""><p>I agree and disagree.

We are still using a lot of Vietnam and gulf war era equipment  but most other countries are so far behind it’s not even funny) they have 1 BILLION people. Idk if you can comprehend how big that number really is in terms of people but it’s over twice the US population. They have no means to invade as their navy and air force are practically non existent (and good luck moving millions of soldiers over an ocean without that) but if we invaded them it would be hell (aside from most likely causing WW3) It also doesn’t matter how many nukes you have if you’re too pussified to use them. Clueless civilians always underestimate other countries. North Korea is a great example of this.

Sciencetist,"This is a very narrow way of thinking. Different groups have different interests -- social welfare, personal profit, power, nationalist ideals, religion -- you can't always reconcile these differences by just making a 50/50 compromise over everything. Authoritarianism -- a political ideology increasingly being espoused by the modern Republican party -- leaves little room for compromise. And yet, the Republican party seems to be achieving many of its short term goals (justices nominated to the SC, gutting social welfare programs, tax breaks for corporations).

Put another way, if my demands and desires are entirely unreasonable or unethical, why should the *other party* have to meet me half-way?

newlife_newaccount,"Hmm. Back when I was 18 in 09, me and 3 other friends piled into my buddy's Nissan Frontier and took a totally spur of the moment weekend trip from Sacramento to Santa Cruz.

Once in Santa Cruz, we spent the hours we had before it got dark on the beach, digging a giant pit. In the center of the pit we made a table, which we used to play beer pong on. We used all the sand we dug out of the pit to form a giant wall facing the ocean to block all the wind. Then we dug chairs and benches all around the table. We played until it got dark, then proceeded to get absolutely plastered, and slept on the beach next to our magnificent creation.

Then the next day, still hungover, we decide to check out some other beaches. We stop at a stop sign near Highway 1, and spot a beach we want to check out. There was a parking lot to the left of us, maybe 10 feet behind where we were stopped. My buddy somehow overlooked the fact that a car had stopped behind us at the stop sign, and proceeded to reverse straight into the car's hood. Crumpled the shit out of it. The driver of the car wasn't too pleased.

peterschiffsgoldd1ck,"Yeah that is true. Its a fairly new car and parts will be expensive as shit. Hey you seem like you know your shit already, i totally thought you just had no idea haha. 

Anyways, im personally not a big fan of the A4’s and was a lifelong mercedes guy, but i have to say the new 5 series/3-series looks stunning and they’ve really out done it with the interiors. And i mean functionality wise. Tbh, you can’t go wrong with any of the big three luxury germans. At that point its just up to stylistic preference/comfortability in the cabin.  Ofc you probably already know that so there isn’t much i can contribute. I would also recommend checking out lexus GS class if you’re going with used... 

i can tell you probably aren’t a lexus guy but it will go a long way if you want to save a pretty penny on maintenance, especially considering that BMW and mercedes feel the need to restructure their engines every goddamn 3 years and require a new set of proprietary parts to repair their cars... 

CLA45 is an AWD but its sportier than something like the A4. Isn’t on the high end when i comes to luxury experience but it definitely up there. It ain’t no honda civic.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah that is true. Its a fairly new car and parts will be expensive as shit.

They went back to see how a group of samples had evolved from ones collected a month prior, only to find out the antibodies for covid in those samples only survived for ~3 weeks. That basically meant any knowledge they could’ve gained was lost to the time-decay of the antibodies. As in: antibodies died off in 3 weeks, so this person’s body doesn’t even remember fighting and sieving covid. Huge setback.</p>

There is no black and white in research. It's not like either everyone going to be immune or not for x months after infections.

You need to know if a big chunk if cases are going to be immune or resistance to re infection

No you needs hundreds of thousands then analys the data to get something like 70% of recovered show immunity for x months.
