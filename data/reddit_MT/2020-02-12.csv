I am in the cloud space and although AWS is dominant, AZure is winning a significant portion of business.  THINK JEDI.  DONT BRING UP POLITICS.  

People getting into MSFT better stop playing FD’s. - 99.99% of people are not turning $1k into $49k.  Long term we are gonna WIN. LEAPS ARE GOIJG TO WIN DAMNIT. SO MUCH WINNING. 

Also set your fuckkng stop losses.  I KNOW YOU PEOPLE WANT A 100x BAGGER BUT A LEAST PICK A FUCKING STOP LOSS.STOP GIVING AWAY MONEY PUSSIES.

Look, SPCE is reminiscent of TSLA in 2010 after their IPO.  Except a huge difference ....is Tesla fucking shipped something.   SPCE has had nothing but delays and had to get bought out.  

SPCE NEEDS TO FUCKING launch something this summer - anything, or it will get burned.  

That said I plan to buy SPCE post ER, or when WSb panic sells, which we all know is coming.

This sell off will likely get worse into q1 reports then begin to recover after q1. This is how markets work. The fact it is also going to be a market holiday Monday means it's a risk off weekend. I'm going to buy on Friday add to my tech positions and just wait till Tuesday for it to bounce again. Begin fading into end of q4 earnings. Sold my calls yesterday and bought mgm puts last night.

Zer033x,"Have MSFT calls and down on them by about 15%, but the pop at end of day helped. I chickened out though and sold calls against my bought calls to essentially lock in current losses until tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll consider buying back sold calls to benefit off upward movement. But this will allow me to sleep tonight and reevaluate tomorrow. It'll be easier to read in the morning, even if I miss out on a gap up.

I wasn't willing to go overnight with the calls, I have 13k in them and any gap down would be devastating. I weighed reason for up or down movement and it was too hard to tell what will happen, but I sided on a high likelihood of gap down or continued slide for rest of week. Reasons below:

Reasons for gap down/go down:

- indexes up almost 1% and MSFT barely moves. Indexes up almost 2% this week, and MSFT down. Indexes due for some cooling off and I'm afraid what a weak day would look like for MSFT given the strong days were horrible.

- Long weekend coming up. Investors will be derisking soon, especially with such a runup so fast. Could come Thurs, but prob will come Friday. Either way probably not good for MSFT.

- Lower bollinger band still shows potential downside to about 180.

- MSFT ran up a lot and fast valuing it at 1.4trillion, might need to dip a bit and cool off.

- That investigation going on about acquisitions.

- AMZN fighting JEDI contract.

Reasons for gap up/go up:

- It's MSFT and has some of the best investor sentiment.

- No analyst upgrades yet. They're probably coming and will be positive.

- Coronavirus worsens leading people away from things like AAPL and back to MSFT.

- Anything else? Can't really think of any short term.","<div class=""md""><p>Have MSFT calls and down on them by about 15%, but the pop at end of day helped.

RubenZ217," I  was only nine years old. I loved Elon Musk so much, I had all the memes and Teslas. I'd pray to Elon every night before I go to bed, thanking  him for the tendies I've been given. ""Elon is love"",  I would say, ""Elon is life"". 

My dad hears me and calls me an autist. I  knew he was just  jealous of my TSLA tendies. I called him a cringe normie.  He slaps me  and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in  bed and it's really cold. 

A warmth is moving towards me.  I feel  something touch me. It's Elon. I'm so happy. He whispers in my  ear:

""Don't doubt your vibe"". 

He grabs me with his powerful Cyber hands, and  puts me on my hands and  knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Elon. He  penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Elon. I can  feel my butt tearing as my  eyes start to water. I push against his  force. I want to please Elon. 

He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my  butt with his love. My dad walks in. Elon looks him straight in the eye,  and says, ""TSLA to the moon"". Elon leaves through my window and drives  away on his Cybertruck.

TastyBlunts,"Today, February 13.

&#x200B;

I plan to stop the flow of free ideas. Today too many people have opinions. I want that to stop. The flow of free information and ideas is forbidden. If you don't have money to YOLO you are worthless. Keep your ideas to yourself. Nobody broke ever invented or did anything amazing. 

With love,

Woke up the morning and sprint went to 8.10 that morning. Based on my math I would have made 17k. And now Shopify . The same thing happened.

There’s only 1 reason you sell, if the reason you originally invested isn’t going as planned.

And there’s only a few reasons you invest in a stock.

*If it has good management*

*If it has a plan for future growth*

*if you understand it’s business model*

If these 4 things are still fine, what’s the point of being bearish?

If you are bearish on the whole market, it won’t last in the bull. Don’t get greedy and take profits when those bearish trades work. You’ll miss out on recovery once it’s priced in.","<div class=""md""><p>Scared money don’t make no money</p>

unfortunately for you  - being logical doesnt make you win the markets.  It just happens to be working in your favour for now.  The markets could easily turn in favour of the bears and suddenly you'd be on the wrong side of the trade.

Theres something called survivorship bias - and it's really good at convincing people they were right when they had absolutely no reason to think that way.  Your ""winning"" position(s) could be extremely temporary.

aphexmandelbrot,"if you can manage to sell it at open at it's current cost or slightly under, it may not be too late for vxx calls especially if you have a daytrade left to burn. 

personally i'd make the call for 2/14 since longterm VIX bets can be a pain due to daily exposure reset. like if some shit goes down that's starting to impact the market one to two hours before close and it seems like it'll still be an issue the next day at open? grab calls with an exp of the next day. 

next day, day two, comes along and stonks go down? VIX is probably up. 

thing that make stonks go down probably resolved by day three? rad. grab a few SVXY calls since it's an inverse exposure ETF. when VIX go up, it goes down; vice versa. sell VXX calls when you've hit a reasonable gain. 

day three, if VIX calmed the fuck down -- SVXY will jump back up.

Bobby3127,"how did you fuck up the correct grammatical use of ""you're"" twice, after being corrected? lol

Just like people invested in WEED told me I was dumb for shorting at $40 a share.   It crashed 50% within a month but they were ""right"" at the time.

My stance isn't that you're wrong right now.  Obviously bulls are making money right now.  My stance is that at literally ANY day - you're subject to massive and sudden losses and you wont get out in time, or worse, you'll buy the dip like you've been trained all the way down.

Im not making money right now, you're right.  But I also won't be suffering extreme losses if/when things turn down, and my bet is that things change drastically within 2 years. 

So enjoy winning while you can? but i can assure you it wont last forever.

There’s no such thing as bull and bear when it comes to short term trading . It’s just a matter of following whatever trend you wanna see.

Real bulls are the ones actually buying and holding stocks , shares. These are your big ass banks , institutions, hedge funds pension funds etc etc. they actually push the market up.

The wash-sale rule was designed to discourage people from selling securities at a loss simply to claim a tax benefit.

A wash sale occurs when you sell a security at a loss and then purchase that same security or “substantially identical” securities within 30 days (before or after the sale date).

If you end up being affected by the wash-sale rule, your loss will be disallowed and added to the cost basis of the securities you repurchased.
