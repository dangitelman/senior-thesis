MyopiaCapital,"The Fed's needing to intervene in the repo market to control the repo rate is directly a result of the ballooning budget deficit.  Repurchase agreements in that market are collateralized with treasuries, and the supply of treasuries has exploded so much relative to the supply of dollars that the market clearing rate for repos has rocketed...we need an entity sitting on an infinite pool of cash to suppress that rate!

For everybody who has ever said that the budget deficit doesn't matter (including me!), it's becoming pretty clear we are wrong.  The Fed needing to consistently provide liquidity to the financial system to compensate is the first consequence of an out of control deficit.

Hopefully enough of you were paying attention, to notice that in late 2018 ((November, December)) the US stock market tanked, and dragged everything down with it.  I think Dow fell to All-Time-Lows like 23,000.  Thanks in no small part to the Bad Orange Man tweeting ""More tariffs on China today!"" whenever he felt like it.


Then in 2019, when all that nonsense stopped and all of his lawyers were ending up in jail, the markets finally recovered, making it look like the year had 15 percent gains. 

BUT THOSE GAINS are just what was lost last Christmas!!

I hope they crash and burn like a lithium battery pack, and further that Ford or GM picks up the brand for pennies on the dollar. This will cause maximum butthurt for all the chode garglers that trip over themselves to blow Musk because they think he's the next coming of christ. 

But until the Fed turns off the money tap and Morgan Stanley realizes slapping an iPad on the dash does not transform an auto manufacturer into a tech stock, they are gonna continue to trade at retarded valuation.

Spartan_Blazer,"Idk if there’s a formal equation for a relationship between theta and IV. But I think they’re independent. IV is high like I said when there’s a much anticipated event that’ll influence share price but IV also spikes on stocks that get crazy volatile all the sudden, like TSLA doing 8% yesterday, except this time the anticipated future event is that it’ll pull back after such a big move, but if it goes up 8% in a day and then remains stable for a while with no significant sell off you get IV crushed because the price has stabilized from spiking up 8% in a day and a pullback seems less likely to happen. Theta decay is how likely a move is to happen given the remaining time in the contract. Bigger moves or more out of the money options become less and less likely to happen as the expiration date nears. Like an AMD $50 call expiring this Friday is probably $0.30 right now but on Friday morning if AMD is trading at $47 it’ll probably be selling at 3 cents because a $3 move in one day seems pretty unlikely
