They were extremely transparent with what I should expect from their product and they even created 3D mockups of what my teeth would look like.. I paid the $2k upfront.

Midgetfarm,"(Kitco News) - A quiet start to the week is weighing on gold prices, but analysts remain optimistic that prices can push higher as easing from the People’s Bank of China could ignite a further drop in global interest rates.

Overnight, the PBOC the interest rate on its medium term loans in an attempt to counteract the economic hit from the growing coronavirus. However, the move has had little impact on gold prices as major North American markets are closed for holidays Monday. Spot gold prices on Kitco.com last traded at $1,581.40 an ounce, down 0.14% on the day.



Despite the weak price action Monday, many analysts are expecting that the PBOC’s latest move will continue to support the yellow metal.


Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said that economists are still trying to estimate the full impact the spreading virus will have on the global economy. He added that this uncertainty will continue to support gold prices.

“We have seen monumental demand destruction this past month and that won’t be resolved anytime soon,” he said. “Central banks will be forced to ease again, but the question is just how much impact further easing will have.”

Looking at China’s economy, Bank of Montreal economists said that they have lowered their growth forecasts and expect China’s GDP to grow 5.25% this year.

“Given that China now accounts for just under 20% of global GDP, that downgrade translates… to a 0.2% cut to global economic growth,” the analysts said.

Afshin Nabavi, head of trading with MKS (Switzerland) SA, said that it is only a matter of time before gold prices push above $1,600 an ounce as growth fears continue to support investment demand.

Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that investors will get a better understanding of the Fed’s position on monetary policy following the release of the minutes from the January monetary policy meeting.

“Whether Chair Powell’s warning about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the US economy will potentially justify a further cut in interest rates remains to be seen, with speculators already pricing in a 43% chance of a rate cut by mid-year,” he said.

Although gold has room to move higher because of growing coronavirus fears, Hansen said that the precious metal still faces a significant hurdle: a saturated marketplace.

“There has been a lot of buying lately, but prices haven’t really gone anywhere,” he said. “Right now, there is no reason to sell your gold, but there are not a lot of new reasons to buy if we don’t see any new price action.”

Invite the XI, the PM of Israel because of Mossad, Japan, Putin, Leader of HK,leader of India, Industrial heads such as Bob Iger, Richard, Musk, Boeing Lockmart & northrop.

Bob Iger would be interesting because Epcot needs to be revamped & Disney has an abandoned run way. HK could be one of the space ports for point to point travel.

Topics could include space mining and maybe the kick start for a Space Mining Race, the need to readdress space economic treaties.","<div class=""md""><p>Trump should announce a low earth orbit space economy economic meeting with leaders once the SpaceX  BFR goes online.</p>

kfuzion,"A stop limit works like this:

Once your stock/option reaches the stop price, you start looking for the exit with the limit being the least you'll take.

One detail in advance - the stop is based on the bid.

$2.15 stop makes zero sense if the current price is $2.15. Stop needs to be below current value. So let's say a $2.10 stop, $2 limit, current bid is $2.15.

Once the bid hits $2.10, limit tries to sell at the best price possible, but minimally $2. If the bid is $2.00, you're out at $2. If the bid is $2.05, out at $2.05. If the bid crashes down to $1.90 before you can fill.. you're fucked unless the option gets back to $2.00. It could hit $1.70, $1.50, and you're still holding.

A standard stop will sell at the current bid, whenever the stop is hit. $2 stop triggers and if the bid is still $2, you're out at $2. If the bid crashes down to $1.90 before you can get a fill.. you're out at $1.90. Still better than being stuck holding at $1.50.","<div class=""md""><p>A stop limit works like this:</p>

A play like this is interesting because many institutional investors are playing 1-2 year LEAPs. That + speculative nature, TSLA style hype and potential for cult holders, etc. means this could be a stock that has a lot of strength.

Also, if you're implying it's speculation, how the hell can it be overbought? That implies an easily identifiable inherent value. Think about that paradox and then decide if you wanna get a piece of the pie or smell the pie from outside through the window.

WikiTextBot,"**Gokkun**

Gokkun (ゴックン) is a Japanese term for sexual activity in which a person, usually a woman, consumes the semen of one or more men, usually from some kind of container. Commonly used containers include cups, large beakers, bowls, baking pans, and wine or cocktail glasses. Most of these scenarios involve the semen of multiple men.

""Gokkun"" can also refer to the sexual act of swallowing semen after performing fellatio or participating in a bukkake.

raconteuring,"That's just not true. You are calculating 0 day mortality rate which is ridiculous on the outbreak of a virus.

Lets say it takes 2 weeks on average to die from the virus (if you are going to die from it).

You go to a football stadium and infect 100,000 people in a day.

The next day the infected rate goes from 70,000 to 170,000 but yet the deaths only go from 1770 to 1870. Wow we more than double the cases in a day but the deaths only increased 100, mortality rate must be dropping right?

HELL NO - why the fuck would you use TODAY'S new infections and calculate the deaths that take 2 weeks to happen?

Check out the 14 day mortality rate, so that would be the people that up to today vs the infection numbers 14 days ago.

That will get you about 10% mortality rate which is going to be much closer to reality than 2.x% that CCP media keeps touting. Keep in mind, this is even using China's (likely cleaned) data.
