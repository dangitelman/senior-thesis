DollarThrill,"RobinHood changes (aka please don't kill yourself over a fake negative balance):

Our team has been hard at work making improvements to our options offering and we would like to share some of them with you today. Many of the updates are already live in your app and we have even more coming soon. Here are some highlights:

We’ve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app: Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.

We’ve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios: If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you’re in a short position due to an early assignment.

We’re making buying power easier to understand: We've begun rolling out updates to how buying power is shown in the app. Instead of showing negative buying power, we’ll show your account deficit amount and the actions you can take to resolve your deficit based on your trading situation.

We’re continuing to expand our options education resources: You can read about advanced options strategies and topics like early options assignments in our Help Center right now, and we’ll be adding more resources in the future.","<div class=""md""><p>RobinHood changes (aka please don&#39;t kill yourself over a fake negative balance):</p>

namsilat,"To those of you making jokes about orders not going through today.


You will, in the fullness of time, become fathers.  Your children, initially the source of so much joy, will howl with laughter at your antics, for a time.

Once your children develop, and we’re talking maybe kindergarten here, they will begin to waver in their boundless affection for you.  Your constant, mindless catchphrases. “Is it hot enough for you, champ?”  “Well son, it is what it is” will begin to grate against their inherent desire to avoid being socially ostracized.

By 12, they will actively hate you, you’ll have gained weight and begin agonizing about which weedwacker string to buy at Home Depot for your particular strain of fescue grass.  You’ll take to wearing polo shirts on every occasion.   You will have developed an embarrassing bald spot, your children have a nickname for it and the laugh behind your back every time you’re out of earshot.  You’ll eat at Olive Garden with your family monthly, because it’s the only thing that’s still “a gosh darned value”.  Your wife will be regularly fucking an Argentinean pottery class professor without your knowledge.

At 56, you’ll be diagnosed with a common brain tumor, inoperable, they’ll tell you.  You’ll weep at the unfairness of it, and your wife and children will tell you to stay strong.

6 months later, you’ll have died, your battle against the disease uninspiring and cowardly.  Your wife will use the bare minimum of your life insurance payout to give you a poorly attended funeral in a strip mall funeral parlor, no one will weep at the service.  You’ll be buried under an unassuming gravestone on a hillside overlooking a freeway interchange.

And nothing of value will have been lost.","<div class=""md""><p>To those of you making jokes about orders not going through today.</p>

normiedelight,"earnings plays for next week:
  
short $work
long $pton

$work play: 

i plan on getting into a $work position before 2pm Tuesday, I’m gonna sell call spreads w a strike 1sd above sell price and buy put spreads with that premium to double down on my bearish sentiment, $work is primarily used for small companies w less than 100 employees, and that sector of the economy has not really recovered.... if I get a 30/40% return the next day, I will get out of those positions, if it goes bullish, I’ll get out with a minimum loss and maybe roll the sold calls,

$pton play:

on Thursday I will try to get into a bullish position before 2pm, I plan on selling put spreads with strikes about 2 dollars above current trading price and using the high premium to buy call spreads right on the money, both of the contracts I’m getting into should have exp for 9/18, will get out of position if I get at least a 30% return or an instant loss on Friday open, imo $pton is gonna crush earnings, they’ve really benefited from the pandemic and it’s common knowledge that they out perform the market at times, 


If both of these plays work, I will have a nice 9/11 and celebrate with a few friends.  that being said

Emerl,"New RH features: 

>Our team has been hard at work making improvements to our options offering and we would like to share some of them with you today. Many of the updates are already live in your app and we have even more coming soon. Here are some highlights:


>We’ve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app: Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.


>We’ve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios: If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you’re in a short position due to an early assignment.

<blockquote>
<p>Our team has been hard at work making improvements to our options offering and we would like to share some of them with you today. Many of the updates are already live in your app and we have even more coming soon. Here are some highlights:</p>

<p>We’ve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app: Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.</p>

<p>We’ve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios: If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you’re in a short position due to an early assignment.</p>

<p>We’re making buying power easier to understand: We&#39;ve begun rolling out updates to how buying power is shown in the app. Instead of showing negative buying power, we’ll show your account deficit amount and the actions you can take to resolve your deficit based on your trading situation.</p>

<p>We’re continuing to expand our options education resources: You can read about advanced options strategies and topics like early options assignments in our Help Center right now, and we’ll be adding more resources in the future.</p>

If I drop below 52k, some miracle brings it back up to 52k at close. If I make some awesome play that boosts it up to 60k, I then make some retarded play that drags it back down to 52k.</p>

ATXBikeRider,"I literally just did this 2 weeks ago.

Model 3.  Had a blast.   Almost got into two accidents though.

First one:. If self driving mode is on and you make a significant adjustment to the wheel it will then turn off.  Kind of like if you had the break briefly in your normal car it will turn off cruise control.

Second one:. I didn't activate the setting that recognizes red lights, stop signs etc.  I expected it to stop at a red but it didn't.  Later I saw the setting.

Aside from that it was really cool.

The pickup and drop off was seamless.  Highly recommend!","<div class=""md""><p>I literally just did this 2 weeks ago.</p>

CamarosAndCannabis,"So I have a couple accounts, some of them I gamble MUCH more degenerately with. One account I absolutely exploded recently, 30k to $700

Took me about a month and it’s back to 5k. Should be another month or so before I get back all the losses.

Literally my only strategy to rebuild that account was/is to take ONE quality trade a day, lock it in for a gain or loss, and just wait for the next day to trade again (this prevents overtrading and revenge trading)

If you have the account as a cash account (like on ThinkorSwim you can change it from a margin account to a cash account by just messaging them), you can day trade every day.

Battlejew420,"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets is a great starter book if you're serious about trading. Its pretty much about identifying trends so you can follow along with the market.

Nassim Taleb's books are some of my favorites, Fooled by Randomness in particular. He doesn't talk much about his strategies or trading, but they're still good reads about trading psychology. 

And Ross Cameron/Warrior Trading is one of the few day traders I've seen that is actually verifiably profitable. He's got some classes and a chatroom, but he has a cheap ebook that is really good as well. I had his chat room for a little while, and it's cool because he trades live every morning. You can get the same info from his book and his YouTube channel for much cheaper tho, imo.

Real talk though, don't take investing advice on WSB, its entertaining to read and fun to gamble along with, but if you actually want to learn to trade- you won't find out by being here lol","<div class=""md""><p>Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets is a great starter book if you&#39;re serious about trading.
