Holding overnight worked out and I sold for a 13k gain on the calls. So even though my original self bet didn't work out, the position did in the end and I decided to donate 500 kangaroo dollars to those brave firefighters.

<p>As Tesla’s shares soared toward $500 in January, <strong>he tattooed the company’s trademark T in a design on his arm</strong>.</p>

<p>“Nothing goes this right, this often,” Mr. White said. “I assumed I was living in a simulation.” </p>

motterpaul,"TSLA:  !!!     NOTE: $100- billion = about $560/share

Tesla shares were trading at $581.40 during the afternoon, giving it a market capitalization of close to $105 billion.

Shares have tripled in value since May, meaning Tesla's market capitalization now exceeds the value of Ford and General Motors, combined.

For Musk, hitting $100 billion in market value triggers an option to buy 1.69 million shares of Tesla stock for $350.02 per share. If he sells the shares, he would make more than $391 million.

BabyDorn,"Everything seems to be going wrong for Boeing. BA -2.74% In the latest batch of bad news, however, there may be some grounds for optimism.

On Tuesday, the Chicago-based plane manufacturer said its grounded 737 MAX jet wasn’t likely to return to service until mid-2020, dashing hopes of a first-quarter recertification.

That means most airlines probably won’t be able to include the MAX in their busy summer schedules, during which many pilots are unavailable to run the required simulator training. Last year, Boeing set aside $5.6 billion to compensate airlines for the grounding. The company reports earnings next week, and Jefferies’ aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimates that the final bill will now rise to around $16 billion.

The MAX assembly line in Renton, Wash., likely won’t be able to restart production until the fall. This is damaging to Boeing’s suppliers, potentially making it harder to ramp up production once the plane finally gets the green light. The delay will also increase costs over the lifetime of the MAX program: Its gross margin is now likely to be around 24%, compared with 30% in 2018, Ms. Kahyaoglu said.

Airbus stock rose on Wednesday. Boeing’s European rival cannot easily ramp up production to replace the MAX, but will likely benefit longer-term from the paralysis in the U.S. company’s other projects—such as building a midsize jet to challenge the best-selling Airbus A321.

The MAX crisis has been a sobering experience for everyone involved. Early estimates of how much it would cost the company were staggeringly wide of the mark, because the crashes ended up revealing deeply rooted problems in a company culture that has been too focused on cost cutting.

This is where Boeing’s announcement has a silver lining.

The latest delay in the MAX’s projected return to service appears to be unrelated to news of a new software glitch, or to fresh frictions with regulators. This is encouraging, given that Boeing’s previous Chief Executive Officer, Dennis Muilenburg, was ousted due to the perception that he was pressuring officials into a quick recertification process.

The new CEO, David Calhoun, seems to be embracing a conservative approach to appease regulators, and trying to front-load the bad news when it comes to investors. This is the right move.

Boeing has lost more than $63 billion in market value since the crash that led to the grounding of the MAX last March. Its stock has fallen 25% during a period in which the S&P 500 has gained more than 20%.

If Mr. Calhoun’s timeline proves accurate, it will build the case that he is ready to implement the more wide-ranging changes necessary to win back investors’ trust.","<div class=""md""><p>Everything seems to be going wrong for Boeing. BA -2.74% In the latest batch of bad news, however, there may be some grounds for optimism.</p>

RareUnicorn,"How do you even get your spreads to fill on TSLA? I’m just buying way OTM options 2 exp out for about $700ish.

Really earnest question, cause idk what people mean when they talk spreads on Amazon or TSLA... The bid/ask is ludicrous, and there’s no volume... just.. How?

edit: I should add I’m on TD, and simply looking at their Vertical chain. I’m not adding legs and building my own, if that’s any factor. I just can’t sell options separate from my buys. They need to be purchased spread. I try to do a debit and it shows infinite loss cause I’m selling one.

<p>Really earnest question, cause idk what people mean when they talk spreads on Amazon or TSLA... The bid/ask is ludicrous, and there’s no volume... just.. How?</p>

<p>edit: I should add I’m on TD, and simply looking at their Vertical chain. I’m not adding legs and building my own, if that’s any factor. I just can’t sell options separate from my buys. They need to be purchased spread. I try to do a debit and it shows infinite loss cause I’m selling one. I’m from RH where they gave me Tier 3 options on day 2, so I could actually lock gains in with spreads, etc. Can’t on TD. Maybe that’s my issue. Gotta be able to buy individual legs?</p>

RareUnicorn,"One reason would be a pseudo-long position on a stock.. You need capital for this, obviously, but you buy a DEEP ITM call that’s at or near 1 Delta.. Boom, you know “own” 100 shares. 

You can now sell calls against that contract in an attempt to make as much premium as possible while holding that long dated call. Only issue is your strikes are incredibly wide, so if you were to get exercised, you’re gonna lose a shit ton.

TL;DR tho, Higher Delta. It’s similar to owning a long position in the stock. Less volatility and usually less profit potential but less risk as well. Just gotta hop off the train before Exp, unless you wanna exercise.. You’d need a large swing to be B/E though.

RareUnicorn,"Tier 3 is what allows you to sell a call... I unfortunately do not have access on TD Ameritrade. So while I used that all the time on RH (and still do... gotta keep RH around just to sell a damn credit spread) it’s literally 2 clicks and 2 questions and they let you do whatever the hell you want. 

Unfortunately other brokerages have “risk profiles” and shit, so they don’t hand out margin trading to every autist with a smartphone. Which is silly imo. Especially given my personal circumstances. Idk if you need $25k to be approved, they say they have no criteria, it’s per account.. I think they just don’t like me cause I trade like a maniac instead of buying a debit spread 2 years out to hedge against my shares of Berkshire Hathaway..

quick edit: to clarify, when you have a call on lets say 1/31, and try to sell a strike above same date, it simply does not recognize that you have a call like RH does, and instantly Rejects the order with a message of “REJECTED: YOUR BUYING POWER WILL BE BELOW 0 - INFINITE”

Probably_Faking_It,"[This is a good description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0J8drGAJS4)

&#x200B;

Essentially, a call is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The agreement is that the buyer of the call has the right to buy a 'lot' (100 shares) of the underlying at a given strike price on or before a given expiration date. The buyer does this because he expects the stock will go up in value, so if he buys it at that strike price, he can then sell the stock at the market price for a profit. For example, let's say GE is trading at $10. I am an options buyer, and I am bullish on GE, so I think it will go up in value. I decide to buy a call option. I buy a call option at the $11 strike that is 1 month out (so roughly 2/21 right now). If I'm right, and GE moves up to, say, $12, then at expiration I get to buy 100 shares of GE at $11, and then can immediately sell them for $12. Which means I made a 100 dollar profit (minus the premium that I paid for the option).

&#x200B;

The seller of the call assumes that the underlying will NOT go up , or may go down. The seller OWNS the 100 shares of the underlying (GE). They sell the call option so that they can collect premium to make money off of their shares. Let's say I own 100 shares of GE, and I'm pretty sure GE isn't going to make any significant moves anytime soon. What the hell am I holding these shares for, then? What I can do, though, is sell calls to people. By selling a call, I'm saying, ""Yeah, sure man, I'll sell you my 100 shares at $11 a share in a month,"" all while assuming the guy  buying the call is a dumbass who is just giving me money. If the seller is right, and at expiration GE hasn't moved up to $11 a share, then the option expires worthless. The buyer won't exercise the call, because he would be buying 100 shares of a stock for more than it is worth.

&#x200B;

So, in a nutshell, call buyers think the stock will go up, and plan to profit off of that movement. Call sellers think the stock will NOT go up, and plan to profit off of someone who will bet against them.

&#x200B;

It should be noted, though, that the degenerates on THIS sub (myself included) buy options without ever expecting to get to expiration. Instead, we buy options with the expectation that we will close them once they become more valuable. Let's take the GE example. Let's say I'm the buyer, and I buy a call on GE at the $11 strike expiring on 2/21. Now, if the stock moves up in value, then the value of the call option also moves up in value. If I want, I can then sell that call option to someone else, and I get to keep the increase as profit. This is essentially what the dude we are talking about is doing with TSLA. He bought a shit load of call options, and then TSLA went way up in value. So, the value of those call options increased. He won't exercise those options, but rather will sell them and keep the increase as profit.","<div class=""md""><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0J8drGAJS4"">This is a good description</a></p>

,"I’d recommend following their monthly reports. Their Leading Economic Index (LEI) is the number is one that shows up on economic calendars and can dictate trading for a day. Probably the best indicator of when the economy has topped out that I know of. Lots of fund managers use it and include it in their pitchbook. 

From what I was taught, the best way to use it is to see when there is divergence in the indexes, especially the LEI. If you look at the technical notes, the stock market is basically the only thing keeping the LEI from taking a bigger tumble. Been declining several months consecutively. Also I’d recommend following KKR’s econ reports, pretty self explanatory.","<div class=""md""><p>I’d recommend following their monthly reports.
