timvrun,"In case you want to play CSX

 

Top-line growth remains challenged for CSX, but productivity initiatives continue to drive bottom-line gains. The railroad was able to surpass our September-period call of $1.05 a share, thanks to additional efficiency gains related to the implementation of the Precision Scheduled Railroading model. The operating ratio improved by nearly 200 basis points year over year, to 56.8% (lower is better). Revenue fell slightly more than we anticipated, due to declines in the intermodal and coal businesses. While sales in the intermodal unit were down about 11% from the prior year, the railroad's decision to cut back on certain corridors probably played a role in the lack of shipments. Meanwhile, the company generated roughly 15% more free cash flow in the third quarter versus last year, as it made fewer capital investments and produced stronger margins. The demand outlook is likely to remain soft heading into 2020. The agricultural,

coal, and intermodal spaces may well experience weakness for a variety of reasons. The trade tensions between the U.S. and China are a big factor, as well as a slower global economy. In the intermodal market, trucking pricing has loosened over the last several quarters, as well. Lower natural gas prices and weaker export demand ought to weigh on the coal franchise. We have reduced our 2020 earnings target by $0.15 a share, due to a lower revenue assumption. Margins may well expand slightly more than we previously expected, thanks to the PSR strategy. This neutrally ranked stock holds below-average capital appreciation potential over the 2022-2024 investment horizon. However, the equity has the highest free cash flow yield of all railroads, and is trading at a discount to its peer group. In addition, should volumes surprise to the upside in 2020, we believe the company will significantly benefit from a reduced cost structure and  a lower capital spending budget, which ought to allow for a greater return of capital to shareholders. All told, on a relative basis CSX, is worth a consideration for buy-and-hold investors looking for exposure to the railroad sector.

The operating ratio improved by nearly 200 basis points year over year, to 56.8% (lower is better). Revenue fell slightly more than we anticipated, due to declines in the intermodal and coal businesses. While sales in the intermodal unit were down about 11% from the prior year, the railroad&#39;s decision to cut back on certain corridors probably played a role in the lack of shipments. Meanwhile, the company generated roughly 15% more free cash flow in the third quarter versus last year, as it made fewer capital investments and produced stronger margins. The demand outlook is likely to remain soft heading into 2020. The agricultural,</p>

<p>coal, and intermodal spaces may well experience weakness for a variety of reasons. The trade tensions between the U.S. and China are a big factor, as well as a slower global economy. In the intermodal market, trucking pricing has loosened over the last several quarters, as well. Lower natural gas prices and weaker export demand ought to weigh on the coal franchise. We have reduced our 2020 earnings target by $0.15 a share, due to a lower revenue assumption. Margins may well expand slightly more than we previously expected, thanks to the PSR strategy. This neutrally ranked stock holds below-average capital appreciation potential over the 2022-2024 investment horizon. However, the equity has the highest free cash flow yield of all railroads, and is trading at a discount to its peer group. In addition, should volumes surprise to the upside in 2020, we believe the company will significantly benefit from a reduced cost structure and  a lower capital spending budget, which ought to allow for a greater return of capital to shareholders. All told, on a relative basis CSX, is worth a consideration for buy-and-hold investors looking for exposure to the railroad sector. Michael Collins, CFA November 22, 2019</p>

Stocks are the most overvalued in decades. The PEG is at 1.8, anything over 1.0 is considered overvalued.

“The S&P 500 is running on fumes,” Bank of America equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian said in a note to clients Thursday.

Also let's talk about that 18.4 price to earnings ratio. Set aside for a moment what your positions are, bullish or bearish. Imagine the stock market is a brand new thing that just got invented. And I am asking you to buy shares, but the price I'm asking you to pay is not what that chunk of the company is worth TODAY, but rather what it will MAYBE be worth 18.4 years from today, if all goes according to plan.

tinypenisguy4,"I just downvoted your comment.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.","<div class=""md""><p>I just downvoted your comment.</p>

WikiTextBot,"**2010 flash crash**

The May 6, 2010, flash crash, also known as the crash of 2:45, the 2010 flash crash or simply the flash crash, was a United States trillion-dollar stock market crash, which started at 2:32 p.m. EDT and lasted for approximately 36 minutes. Stock indices, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, collapsed and rebounded very rapidly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its second biggest intraday point drop (from the opening) up to that point, plunging 998.5 points (about 9%), most within minutes, only to recover a large part of the loss.

Fiddli,A better way is setting a number for the day that will get you to stop making plays for that day. For example for me if I'm up 1.5k in a day I don't open anything else  and set stop loss at my 1.5k up position. My max loss for day is -500. If I'm down 500 on a day I dont open any new position for that day and I try to exit my current positions with minimal loss. This all depends on your trading style.,"<div class=""md""><p>A better way is setting a number for the day that will get you to stop making plays for that day.

coco4shade,"Yeah brother, I'm up 17.7% the past month from buying options dated 3-6 weeks out.  Its awesome.  Basically I check the markets 2-4 times/day instead of being glued to my phone watching every cent price change and how it effects my FDs.  

Honestly buying dated options like that I make most of my money in pre market or after market.  And I usually only hold on to them for 3-5 days.  You can hold longer for more gains, but also more potential losses.  

I've been doing this with SPY, MSFT, AAPL, FB, TWTR, and made a pretty decent return the past 4 months.  Set a stop loss for what your bottom line is as well, and take the L like a man instead of holding on with retardation, hoping your $690 option that is now worth $86 will bounce back.....should have set a stop loss for $~$600 in that case.  Your gains will off set your losses if you set a stop loss at a reasonable price.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah brother, I&#39;m up 17.7% the past month from buying options dated 3-6 weeks out.

coco4shade,"It's the truth.  Invest $500/month, at a basic 10% that's $50 your first month + $500 investment next month brings you to $1050.  10% of that is $105, + your $500 investment the next month, brings you to $1655.  10% of that brings you in $165, plus your $500 deposit brings you to $2310 after 3 months.  That's turning $1500 into $2310, keep it up and you'll be rich after a couple years.  

In theory it's that easy, but of course you'll have some bad months at -10 to -30%, but then you'll have some great months of +25-50%.  And of course it's not very realistic, returning 10%/month.   But it is very possible, even with one trade.  $500 into 3-6 week out MSFT calls at the right time could *easily* net you more than 10% on your $500 each month.  

The key is investing whatever you can every month, and making smart plays with that instead of throwing your life savings into FDs.  

It's really a marathon not a race.  Let your account grow organically instead of YOLOing on meme stocks.  Yeah, you could get filthy rich with a stroke of luck, but 99.99% of the time you'll just lose all your money.

Loudinside2,"Thanks for the explanation! So you're renting your $3k for $5 gain for every 25 cent move? That's 0.16% per 25 cents. So if you would've got it yesterday and it jumped $1.50 you would've 6x your $5 gain per 25 cents. So $30 gain for 3k hold is 0.1% per day. 

And without theta I guess $3k wouldn't deteroriate but with that money you could've just bought around 10x SPY outright and earned $15.

So future you're able to double your gains instead of holding the stock outright?

I'm not understanding the 50x leverage you're talking about and why that would earn you $12.50 (instead of $1.25) per 25 cent tick. With the above example I think it'll be even better if you can 10x your gains if you but are you risking way more money if the trade doesn't go your way?

coco4shade,"Get rich!  But slowly!  Haha unless you get terminal cancer and have 4 years to live at age 25 I don't see a whole lot of point playing FDs.  Except with maybe 2-3% of your total portfolio, but they're more just lotto tickets.  

It's definitely a marathon, check out r/financialindependence as well, they have some great content on how to get rich slowly and steadily.  But most of them are boring and say give it to hedge funds/mutual funds/401k/Roth IRA, which are all good options.  But I trust myself with my money more than a coked out desk jock.  It's not that hard.  

SPY is up 30% YTD so literally you could've grown your portfolio 30% just by buying and holding SPY which is nuts.  There's many way s to go about it, and I like to think I'm educated high risk vs just dumb luck FDs.","<div class=""md""><p>Get rich!  But slowly!
