knotswag,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Today we traded exactly as crayon trendlines projected, [as seen here on the hourly chart.](https://imgur.com/ADiXSlC) As such, tomorrow we're likely to trade within the trendlines until we get news on the trade deal Wednesday. We're nearing inflection on the PPO so my sense is that if something bad happens related to the trade deal, we break that 324.8 support and start heading downwards. If the trade deal is signed and it's to the market's satisfaction, we break the current resistance trendline and go to the next zone upwards, which is a push for 330. 

So in short, tomorrow is probably going to be quite range-bound (~328.2), likely closing around or below that number in anticipation of Wednesday. It will also be important to watch CPI-- if there's a large miss we may also head downwards, though as I've mentioned, our floor is 324.8.

“Teslas will soon talk and make fart noises, Elon Musk says”

In the clip Musk shared on Twitter, a Model 3 rolls by as the speakers play, “Well don’t just stand there staring. Hop in.”

“Teslas will soon talk to people if you want,” he said in the tweet on Saturday. “This is real.”

Musk added that on top of speaking with pedestrians, drivers could use the feature to emit a fart noise.

While no details have been released about the feature, it appears to rely on external speakers, which electric car manufacturers were forced to add to vehicles to comply with U.S. and EU safety regulations. The regulations require electric cars to produce artificial noise at low levels to prevent pedestrian accidents.","<div class=""md""><p><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/elon-musk-teases-a-new-talking-car-feature-for-tesla.html"">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/elon-musk-teases-a-new-talking-car-feature-for-tesla.html</a></p>

Loudinside2,"Nice! I think closing early is a better strategy than waiting for it to expire worthless if you can turn it around and get another put credit spreads with your initial investment. And like you said, lock in profit. 

I got mine last Friday for $80, closed for $9. Got another one for $94 with my initial collateral and already earned $19 from that. Had I held my original put credit spread until 4 pm today it would've sold for $6 so I would've left $13 ($19 - $6 is $13) and more I would collect from tomorrow's move off the table. I did the same thing before with $75 closing for $9. It's small amount but if you can earn that everyday or even every other day it adds up :)
