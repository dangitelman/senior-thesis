GeoDudeBroMan,"Gonna be interesting to see how Iran responds, we havent seen an act of aggression on Iran like this since the 1970s during the Iranian revolution.

To think this whole thing started because Trump is all about that Saudi dick and placed sanctions on Iran so they could steal Iran's market share. Make no mistake, this is 100% the US's fault for ratcheting up aggression with Iran.

That being said, how Iran responds is REALLY going to determine how much war premium we put on oil. The interesting thing about this situation is Iran's economy is already struggling with sanctions and any kind of increased US military activity in the gulf of oman would make it VERY difficult to smuggle oil out. BUTTTTTTT on the flip side the Caspien sea is to the north of Iran  and one of Irans closest ally, Russia, has a port on the northern end of the sea. Russia could potentially help Iran smuggle oil out.

Today it's dumping like no tomorrow while the rest of the sector is holding up a bit better.

If you're looking to get in for earnings this is probably the day (if the market doesn't dump further next week)

Going in with shares cause my play money it tied to gold calls

motterpaul,I have been through this one. The problem is you also make some of your best gains overnight. And unless you start trading before the bell you can't catch up during the day.  I used to wake up and if I saw an open like we had today I would close my positions and just miss the rebound. Today I sat tight and was up $1200 by EOD (pretty good for my shitty acct right now).,"<div class=""md""><p>I have been through this one.

50Asperger_60Dumb,"deliveries grew something like 50% YoY. 300k deliveries 2019

if they keep the 50% growth rate up for the next 7-10 years they will be delivering 10 million cars per year in 7-10 years. Daimler, Bmw , Toyota,  ford, Gm, Hyundai, Wolkswagen are producing in a range 5-10 million cars per year I think. 

is 50% growth sustainable ? car manufacturing is very competitive, so idk about sustainable growth.  margins aren't that great either. 

its quite big if that TSLA will have some magical operating leverage to achieve big margins and be able to return any cash to investors.

The problem with growth is that the growth should return more than the cost of capital to have any value at all !

Second problem is you need lots of capital in a capital intensive industry. TSLA took too much debt too early ? even if it will be profitable at some point how diluted will the current shares be at that point?","<div class=""md""><p>deliveries grew something like 50% YoY. 300k deliveries 2019</p>

<p>if they keep the 50% growth rate up for the next 7-10 years they will be delivering 10 million cars per year in 7-10 years. Daimler, Bmw , Toyota,  ford, Gm, Hyundai, Wolkswagen are producing in a range 5-10 million cars per year I think. </p>

<p>is 50% growth sustainable ? car manufacturing is very competitive, so idk about sustainable growth.  margins aren&#39;t that great either. </p>

<p>its quite big if that TSLA will have some magical operating leverage to achieve big margins and be able to return any cash to investors.</p>

<p>The problem with growth is that the growth should return more than the cost of capital to have any value at all !</p>

<p>Second problem is you need lots of capital in a capital intensive industry. TSLA took too much debt too early ? even if it will be profitable at some point how diluted will the current shares be at that point?</p>

WikiTextBot,"**Millennium Challenge 2002**

Millennium Challenge 2002 (MC02) was a major war game exercise conducted by the United States Armed Forces in mid-2002. The exercise, which ran from July 24 to August 15 and cost $250 million, involved both live exercises and computer simulations. MC02 was meant to be a test of future military ""transformation""—a transition toward new technologies that enable network-centric warfare and provide more effective command and control of current and future weaponry and tactics. The simulated combatants were the United States, referred to as ""Blue"", and an unknown adversary in the Middle East, ""Red"", with many lines of evidence pointing at Iran as the red side.

Gingermanns,"I mean more like loan modifications.  

It obviously depends on the property, but commercial short sales are rare - if the Bank is really worried, they'll get a personal guaranty from the principals of the Borrowing entity.  

The Loan to Value ratios on multi family or mixed use buildings often won't exceed more than 75%.  Even if the appraisal was off by 15%, (or there is a correction in real estate value, like in 2008), there's a 10% equitable cushion for the Bank.  And that cushion assumes a short sale occurred on month following closing, when no principal has been paid down - something that will never happen.   

If the property becomes stressed, such that the debt service coverage ratios dip below the allowable ratio in the mortgage, /loan agreement (translation: two mom and pop commercial tenants operating in the ground floor of a 6 family building went bankrupt, and there is now no rental income from those units), Banks are willing to work out a deal with the Borrower to modify the terms of the existing loan, instead of incurring the expense of a foreclosure, running the risk of a deficiency, and suing to recover form the principals personal assets.

This is way past the original question, which I think I misunderstood.  

Commercial property did take a hit, but not as large as a residential McMansion.  They did recover faster, too.  Much of a commercial property's value is determined by the rents tenants pay.
