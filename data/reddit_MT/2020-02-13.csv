knotswag,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

We had a ""down"" day today in that we closed red [as foretold by the crayons,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2plur/daily_discussion_thread_february_12_2020/fhfazvo/) but for all intents and purposes we were flat. Buyers (or algos, or repo, or whatever pumping) continue to step in when weakness shows. Looking at /NQ futures, we're still following the crayons perfectly, [including a reaction last night at resistance and another reaction today to close.](https://imgur.com/XH4DTvx) As I mentioned yesterday, this trend has been extremely strong (since Nov 2019) so until it breaks this trend I think we'll trudge along-- small pullback, slow grind up. Rinse repeat until we break support, then we re-assess if it can break back into this Nov 2019 channel.

For all other crayons, SPY and VIX are testing their resistance/support once again after both having a reaction, as I outlined last post. Because we're in a bullish market, even if they keep sitting along ""testing"" their trends, because SPY is in an uptrend and VIX is in a downtrend, it means the market will eventually wind up being green until further notice.

For those playing MSFT, it's still hovering at its support after breaking from its January upward trend so nothing notable to report since Tuesday.

People have been wondering if there will be broad market sell-off tomorrow. If there is, we have good support at 335.3, which if it goes will lead to approximately 334.7. Resistance tomorrow end of the day is 338, but since we've been trading in a divergent high lately, the other resistance is 338.7.

Retail sales is being announced tomorrow and has traditionally far underperformed the 0.3% projection during Feb. Keep an eye out and keep your tendies safe and sound.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>Magical Crayons TA.</strong></p>

ImAnEngnineere,"I think that the ""new"" sorting lends itself to turning this discussion into merely a chat feature, which causes a high amount of shitpost comments which prevents people from being serious because they know they'll be lost in the sea of autism.  ***But*** if it was a any other sorting mode, then it would be more difficult to get the minute by minute analysis of WSB on the market which is actually pretty entertaining and helpful

I propose two threads:

* One for a daily discussion that would lend itself to longer term options holders that aren't really day trading but more speculating on the bigger picture but still on a daily basis.
   * sorting will be by best so that popular tickers stay near the top and people aren't pumping their pharma pennystocks.
   * all top level comments will be just a ticker symbol so that people can scroll to their ticker and post their positions or analysis and others can create relevant threads underneath.
   * this will also allow other members to hide everything about a symbol they don't care about by collapsing the top most comment.
* The other will be the same daily discussion that we already have sorted by new.

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

Im gay so I play tsla, but here's what I've got.

Someone brought up how tsla chart is so far forming the exact chart for a stock bubble seen [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=chart+of+stock+bubble&client=ms-android-verizon&prmd=nisv&sxsrf=ACYBGNS8E11UvCl1-OGO9v7liuH_8ltw9Q:1581644274663&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_uJuJ9M_nAhWXITQIHYJlBs4Q_AUoAnoECA8QAg&biw=412&bih=604&dpr=3.5#imgrc=Z5pXL2v0MzxpfM)

Now this chart is saying tsla is in its "" return to normal stage"" which means barring a catalyst we are going to be leveling out/ minor moonings such as today 


While I give this merit, my contention is that tsla is going to look more like Amazon's chart. A similar rise with a massive dip followed by a return to similar levels. 

Either way I'm betting that this isn't the top on tsla. China factory too new to account for an meaningful hit on sales. Rumors of China factory 2. Projections for massive growth with the self driving taxi systems(7k price target).

The best move it to buy calls or sell puts or sell calls buy puts depending on your mind, as close to ITM as possible. This makes sure that if it moves in your favor then you make bank.</p>

<p>I did this with MGM yesterday by buying a put at 33.5 this morning I sold it for 100% gain. IV is bad only if you buy before earnings and the option doesn&#39;t go ITM.</p>

<p>If that worries you, buy options further out or: accept that you have a 50/50 shot of doubling or losing it all. Which is what WSB is all about in essence ✌✌✌</p>

WikiTextBot,"**Patrick Henry**

Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736 – June 6, 1799) was an American attorney, planter, and orator best known for his declaration to the Second Virginia Convention (1775): ""Give me liberty, or give me death!"" A Founding Father, he served as the first and sixth post-colonial Governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786.

Henry was born in Hanover County, Virginia, and was for the most part educated at home. After an unsuccessful venture running a store, and assisting his father-in-law at Hanover Tavern, Henry became a lawyer through self-study. Beginning his practice in 1760, he soon became prominent through his victory in the Parson's Cause against the Anglican clergy.

The only thing you might be missing is that I bought these when they were well OTM (NVDA was trading at $250). I bought two for a total cost of $550, because that was how much money I had available. I sold one at $600 just to lock in the profit and give me a free trade basically.

At the time I bough these $270 seemed reasonable post earnings and $285 seemed unreasonable, for a few reasons, but not the least of which being that NVDA has been trading in an uptrending channel for the last 6 months and the top of that channel, on this date, was about $270.

<p>I dont understand where this perception is coming from? You are not the first person who tried to argue that people do not drive cars in NYC.</p>

<p>I do not live in a suburb and every family I know owns a car. It takes at least 20 min or longer to find a spot after work because everyone is driving home and parking their car in NYC on the 
street.</p>
