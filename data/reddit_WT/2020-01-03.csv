xxxesus,"**THE 2018 END-OF-YEAR FAKEOUT??**

Hopefully enough of you were paying attention, to notice that in late 2018 ((November, December)) the US stock market tanked, and dragged everything down with it.  I think Dow fell to All-Time-Lows like 23,000.  Thanks in no small part to the Bad Orange Man tweeting ""More tariffs on China today!"" whenever he felt like it.


Then in 2019, when all that nonsense stopped and all of his lawyers were ending up in jail, the markets finally recovered, making it look like the year had 15 percent gains. 

BUT THOSE GAINS are just what was lost last Christmas!!

johntaylor37,"Yep. I work at one of the big firms. We obviously don’t get paid when the US military does an air strike, and in general we are not in the loop unless our contracted work would require it. We only get paid when the DoD allocates a slice of their budget to a contract and we win it and then fulfill our obligations. If that contract is for building drones, we probably get paid when they order more drones and we provide them. 

This rise is based on speculation that Iran could become the next Iraq war and that means in the long term defense companies will have more work coming to support the military’s requirements through new future contracts. If they start to fly their drones a lot more because of Iran, they may need more repairs or replacements, design changes, etc. 

For instance some aircraft engines are prone to sucking in sand when landing on the desert. That wears them out quickly. After replacing a lot of engines, the DoD might want us to design a shroud to keep the sand out and to procure and install 1000 of them ASAP because Pratt can’t build replacement engines fast enough and they don’t want any jets parked for repairs. New contracts, more work, more revenue. 

If the DoD spends it all because of war they can ask congress for a budget increase and that’s what would really make a difference.","<div class=""md""><p>Yep. I work at one of the big firms.

chaney3,"IMO, The biggest risk factor to LMT was political risk in the F-35 development program which is projected to account for about 25% of revenue. With increasing conflict tensions this risk has been substantially reduced. Additionally, the budget of US military spending is projected to grow under continued republican control of congress and executive branches respectively. The other high risk factor is its ability to manage debt which is less and less of a concern these days as the FED is absolutely determined to keep borrowing rates at outrageously artificially low rates as we ween into the late cycle. As long as $LMT can service its debt and does not have a cut in funding from political entities it is a long in my book, and increasing tensions with Iran will only continue to eliminate the risk factors associated with this equity. Barring any overall economic / systemic downturn as well as significant rate hikes, you can expect solid revenue, profit, cash flow and stock price growth from $LMT.","<div class=""md""><p>IMO, The biggest risk factor to LMT was political risk in the F-35 development program which is projected to account for about 25% of revenue.

Or do they just turn around and put a $80,000,000 on you if you get Trump? I suspect no one will even attempt to get the money since the Iranians have a poor track record of doing what they promise.

rocklee8,"Iran won't affect Disney in 2020. If you're speculating on Disney in 2020, I think the major movers are going to be how their movies do and how Disney+ does. In general, do you think their new major movies will exceed or fall below expectations.

Personally, I would be cautious with Disney on a leveraged call position because I don't think their movie pipeline is strong next year: no star wars, B-tier Marvel movies, etc. I think the best movie is going to be Mulan. Onward, the new Pixar movie, has a good shot of being a hit because it's one of the first new stories from Pixar in a while, but it's kind of male centric. The other big movies I predict for next year are Top Gun by Paramount and Tenet by WB.

Disney+ the only 2 major shows coming out in 2020 are The Mandalorian Season 2 and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. I think Disney+ is going to be driven by parents realizing their kids can now be entertained for $10 a month from the archive catalog but I'd suspect that growth is already priced in.

In short, Disney seems risky to me from a product perspective for 2020. I do believe in long Disney though, like 2030.","<div class=""md""><p>Iran won&#39;t affect Disney in 2020.

FadedOffTheVape,"AAPLs weighting in SPY is worth more than the 3rd and 4th combined, Amazon and Facebook.

They recently passed MSFT for 1st. 

Sure SPY will get carried up with it. But how many Apple products do you own? The higher the device count, the more likely you’ll see that AAPL products are worth more than SPY itself. 

This is all stuff you learn in Basic Econ 101. 

You ever hand someone your Titanium White Apple Card? They don’t even know which way is up, they’re baffled, think you’re wealthier than you are just because your card is metal. I’ve gotten girls numbers, high fives from dudes at the drive through. 

One time I was in a supermarket in this fairly small town out in the Midwest, and I shit you not, as I’m paying for my groceries, who’s behind me? Mark Fucking Cuban...

He saw me tap my Watch against the scanner to pay and instantly stopped me.

He asked why I just did that. No clue what he meant. He says “Your watch, why’d you just do that?”

Mark Cuban then proceeds to give me VIP Skybox seats to the Mets game that was coming up so we could talk more about this. He wanted to invest in my idea of paying with your watch.

I just  laughed and nodded, went to the game, Mark didn’t even show up so I just sat there drinking free mimosas and kissing pretty girls while the Mets did their thing or whatever.","<div class=""md""><p>AAPLs weighting in SPY is worth more than the 3rd and 4th combined, Amazon and Facebook.</p>

He‘ll be the guy who collects money from the other guys to give to his mafia, the guys running are his crew but he doesn’t give a fuck about them. People like to glorify the Italian mafia but putting 3rd world immigrants to work without paying taxes is one of their main enterprises (alongside fake Parmesan cheese and fraudulent olive oil). The authorities only care because none of the mafia employees pay taxes. The Italian tax agency makes the IRS look like a bunch of children. They have the power equivalent of the FBI vs state police. This is why in Italy you practically get the receipt stapled to your hand whenever you buy anything, the tax gestapo could be around the corner ready to demand a receipt from you the customer because pretty much every business owner used to cook the books. Meanwhile the food police have the power of the DEA and will kick doors down to discover a fake Permesan operation or olive oil lab (soybean oil). I’ve been trying to find a broker that will let me do options on the Borsa Italia for a few months now to get various calls whenever there are any news about either agency making a significant food product/ unpaid tax bust.","<div class=""md""><p>Sad!

DeliciouslyUnaware,"Higher delta means that you lose value much faster than OTM options when the market immediately tanks because you bought a call.

An option that starts ITM and moves .2% closer to being ATM will lose more value than an OTM option that moves .2% further OTM.

ITM options also tend to have a higher Vega, meaning that any amount of volatility drop off will mean faster depreciation of the contract.
