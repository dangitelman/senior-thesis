LessThanCleverName,"> By the end of 1992, the account's losses exceeded £2 million to £23 million in late 1993. This amount ballooned to £208 million by the end of 1994.[17] Leeson had followed a ""doubling"" strategy: every time he lost money, he would double the amount that was lost in order to recoup the amount. This had been successful for him in the past, including once in 1993 where he was able to cover a £6 million negative balance in the account and after which he vowed not to use the account again. However, Leeson had to maintain his reputation as a trading genius and soon found himself hiding his losses there again. As the losses grew higher and higher, Leeson fabricated cover stories to explain why he needed more cash from London. His sterling reputation protected him from close scrutiny.[18]

>The beginning of the end occurred on 16 January 1995, when Leeson placed a short straddle in the Singapore and Tokyo stock exchanges, essentially betting that the Japanese stock market would not move significantly overnight. However, the Kobe earthquake hit early in the morning on 17 January, sending Asian markets, and Leeson's trading positions, into a tailspin. Leeson attempted to recoup his losses by making a series of increasingly risky new trades (using a long-long future arbitrage), this time betting that the Nikkei Stock Average would make a rapid recovery. However, the recovery failed to materialise.[17]

>Leeson left a note reading, ""I'm sorry"" and fled Singapore on 23 February. Losses eventually reached £827 million (US$1.4 billion), twice Barings's available trading capital. After a failed bailout attempt, Barings Bank, which had been the UK's oldest merchant bank, was declared insolvent on 26 February.[19] After fleeing to Malaysia, Thailand, and finally Germany, Leeson was arrested in Frankfurt and extradited back to Singapore on 20 November 1995,[20] though his wife Lisa was allowed to return to England. While he had authorisation for 16 January short straddle, he was charged with fraud for deceiving his superiors about the riskiness of his activities and the scale of his losses. Several observers have placed much of the blame on Barings's own deficient internal auditing and risk management practices.

>Leeson pleaded guilty to two counts of ""deceiving the bank's auditors and of cheating the Singapore exchange"",[2] including forging documents.[21] Sentenced to six and a half years in Changi Prison in Singapore; he was released in 1999, having been diagnosed with colon cancer, which he survived despite grim forecasts at the time. In 1996, Leeson published an autobiography, Rogue Trader, detailing his acts. A review in the financial columns of The New York Times stated, ""This is a dreary book, written by a young man very taken with himself, but it ought to be read by banking managers and auditors everywhere.""[8] In 1999, the book was made into a film of the same name starring Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel. The events also form the subject matter of a 1996 television documentary made by Adam Curtis, titled Inside Story Special: £830,000,000 – Nick Leeson and the Fall of the House of Barings.[22]

satireplusplus,"The Chinese can fudge all the numbers they want, there are still people suffering and terrible fates with this virus at the end of the day. Its not just a number or statistic.

**A family of four in Wuhan all passed away due to the virus. Translation of the husbands final words: [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f535md/a_family_of_four_in_wuhan_all_passed_away_due_to/)**

Chang Kai, 55 years old, a director in Hubei, he spent his career in preserving traditional Chinese opera. His father passed away at the third day of Chinese New Year, his mother passed away six days, him and his sister both passed away in Feb 14.

His wife is also infected, so far her condition is ok.

His son is studying in UK currently.

I am not a professional translator, but I think people should read about his last words. How many tragedies we don’t know? The death of Chinese people is not just a number.

Director Chang Kai worte beautifully in the classic Chinese style so I can only translate the meaning of them.

Translation:

At Chinese New Year‘s eve, I cancelled dinner reservation at a fancy hotel according to public policies.

I cooked a dinner at home my wife and our parents, we all had a great time.

Little did I know, a nightmare has arrived. First day of new year, my old man was having a fever with coughing, he had trouble breathing. Too him to mutiple hospitals and was told there's no vacancy, no matter how hard we tried to get help, we still couldnt get my dad into a hospital.

We were disappointed, we went home. Couple days later, there's nothing we could do, my father passed away in a not peaceful way. Under such tragedy, my mom‘s mind and body, she was infected too and passed away not long after.

While talking care of my parents, the virus also infected me and my wife. We went to many hospitals, asking begging for treatments, yet we are just nobody. Now our conditions are severe, we‘ve missed the best time to get treatments.

Now I am at my last breath, I want to tell my friends and my son in UK: in my whole life, I‘ve been a good son, a responsible father and a loving husband, I am an honest man! Goodbye, to those who love me and the ones I love.","<div class=""md""><p>The Chinese can fudge all the numbers they want, there are still people suffering and terrible fates with this virus at the end of the day.

The_Pandemonium,"Well. 

Last Sunday I was rudely banned for making a joke about making 22 cents via dogecoin. Mods confirmed big time 🌈. If it makes you feel better mods I have since lost the 22 cents, but don't worry, the day of the doge is still upon us. 

This past week, while banned from wsb, has been undoubtedly my most profitable trading week yet. Some would call this coincedence 🤔. Unaffected by literal mental retardation I didn't find myself wasting buying power on dumb plays that would ineveitably fail. My worst play was letting my msft calls fall from 450% to 225% before cashing out. I have since reloaded with 190c 4/03's, a single contract has probably the same value as 80% of the members here portfolio. 

I have watched from afar as retards screeched about going all in on plays with their whole 325 bucks of buying power. Don't worry, rack up enough good boy points and mommy will give you another 25 bucks to play with at the end of the week. I have watched as retards made the same jokes day after day with no creativity or variation. I have watched the retard bears scream that this is the top, while literally stocks keep going up. What a week. 

It has also come to my attention that you have banned my friend Winkerpack, not very kosher of you 😬. 

Boys 🍻 

You might be able to ban me from the sub, but you cannot ban me from the book 😎.

freehouse_throwaway,"Gonna start adding more to my RH short position. Puts are pricey as fuck if you go past May, but the shares does have a 30% short interest as of 1/31 numbers and market is pricing in premiums accordingly (both ways for calls and puts).

While they've said they mitigated Chinese manufacturing impact due to trade war/tariff by raising pricing, working with vendors, and moving select production out of China (these steps were taken and reported in Q1 2019 ER and they continued the same statement as of last ER) - they are still heavily dependent on China and the entire furnishing sector is being impacted heavily by voodoo Virus from everything I read.

This could all be priced in already given they've already did the dive to low $20X during peak of Virus fear but at current pricing level imo they are richly valued regardless of virus shit. While being a ""luxury"" brand they can afford to play with numbers and adjust - eventually these current events will catch up to them. Catalyst playing for is a warn during or before ER (coming up around March 26).
