nahog99,"Whenever you hear someone say ""Buy and hold"" what they actually mean is:

* Buy and hold
* Diversify
* Rebalance from time to time.

No one thinks that you should buy and hold one thing forever because that one thing might go bankrupt and you might be missing out on something else which is sky rocketing. What they mean by ""buy and hold"" is don't fucking sell because of short term dips. If you time them wrong it can be disaaaaastrous cause not only do you sell for a loss of whatever% but if you don't get back in before things come back up you could miss out on huge gains on the up swing. 

From this article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/

>How much exactly? 
JPMorgan's asset management arm has put an exact price to these missed days in its Guide to Retirement report. If you invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 on Jan. 3, 2000 and left it completely invested until Dec. 31, 2019, you would've received an average annual return of just over 6%. Your $10,000 would've grown to $32,421.

>This 20-year period of time includes roughly 5,000 days during which the stock market was open. But as the table below shows, if you missed just the 10 best days out of those 5,000, you'd have less than half as much money. Miss the best 20 days, and you'd barely have made any money at all over 20 years, and you'd have lost money if you missed more winning days.

StonkGoUp,"Usually I wouldn’t post stuff like this in here, but markets are closed for a few days and I know this applies to some of you. **If you’re an aspiring gym bro give it a read, if not scroll by.**

Okay boys it’s the new year and I know some of you idiots are drooling thinking over the absolutely sick 6 pack you’re going to have next summer after you start going to the gym. You know, because you signed a hypothetical contract between your smooth brain and the rotation of the Earth or whatever. Here are some tips from someone who has been working out for 5 years and has a subjectively decent physique.

-Tip 1- Use your stupid money brain to your advantage. You don’t have to get addicted to the gym but you can get addicted to a pre-workout you take before the gym. Get a decent tasting pre-workout with 200-250mg of caffeine. Don’t go too crazy or you’ll end up sick more often than pumped. Fuck anyone that says pre-workout is shit. This dose of caffeine is fine to take and a little bit of Sucralose isn’t going to kill you. Most pres have beta alanine and if you haven’t taken it before you’re going to feel like a crackhead but this calms down and personally I love the feeling. This craving of a quick dopamine spike will motivate you to get your ass off the couch. Half the battle is getting into your car to drive there.

-Tip 2- No one fucking cares how much weight you push if your form is shit. Start with low weight and focus on good form. I know you think the chick across from you in the lulus is dripping watching you snap your spine deadlifting 405, but she’s actually going gone to her boyfriend and laughing about the retard she saw in the gym punishing every collective joint in his body in one swift motion. No one is looking at you thinking you’re a pussy for deadlifting 135, actually they are probably mentally congratulating you for not being a buffoon like half the New Year guys. 

-Tip 3- No one will tell you this, but you actually burn a minimal amount of calories during a lifting session. Your most intense workout of weight training will probably burn less than 300 calories. Before you get home and congratulate yourself with a pint of ice cream remember that you will be gaining back those calories burned and some. You will still build muscle, but you will put on fat.  

I’m not going to make this any longer than it is, because I know you guys have trouble with the whole “reading” thing. But feel free to ask questions/discuss. As dumb as you are I love you mother fuckers and I want to see you succeed","<div class=""md""><p>Usually I wouldn’t post stuff like this in here, but markets are closed for a few days and I know this applies to some of you. <strong>If you’re an aspiring gym bro give it a read, if not scroll by.</strong></p>

recently announced the successful completion of a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the development of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) assisted therapy for an anxiety disorder. 

🍄 said preliminary data has been analyzed for its addiction treatment program evaluating the ibogaine derivative 18-MC, which the company named Project Layla. The preliminary data from the Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study has shown that the drug is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested to date, and no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have been reported.

They also applied to be listed on NASDAQ. When that goes through, gonna rocket so fast. A lot of RHers have it on their radar but cant buy because robinhood sucks.

milezy,"Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you.   
Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses.   
Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day.  
My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits.   
Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid?  Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper.

On high IV stocks I just do bull call spreads like dogcorleone suggested. For example, I bought 10 jan 2022 NIO 45c/80c spreads a month ago. I bought the 45c for just under $18 per contract and sold the 80c for $11 per contract. My downside risk is under $7,000. Max profit is $28,000 and breakeven is 52. There is no reason to further fund Thetagang by hedging this position because my downside is minimal and it’s a potential 400% gang.","<div class=""md""><p>What are you hedging against?

I bought the 45c for just under $18 per contract and sold the 80c for $11 per contract. My downside risk is under $7,000. Max profit is $28,000 and breakeven is 52. There is no reason to further fund Thetagang by hedging this position because my downside is minimal and it’s a potential 400% gang.</p>

nahog99,"What they mean when they say that is actually 

* Buy and hold
* Diversify
* Rebalance from time to time.

No one thinks that you should buy and hold one thing forever because that one thing might go bankrupt and you might be missing out on something else which is sky rocketing. What they mean by ""buy and hold"" is don't fucking sell because of short term dips. If you time them wrong it can be disaaaaastrous cause not only do you sell for a loss of whatever% but if you don't get back in before things come back up you could miss out on huge gains on the up swing. 

From this article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/

>How much exactly? 
JPMorgan's asset management arm has put an exact price to these missed days in its Guide to Retirement report. If you invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 on Jan. 3, 2000 and left it completely invested until Dec. 31, 2019, you would've received an average annual return of just over 6%. Your $10,000 would've grown to $32,421.

>This 20-year period of time includes roughly 5,000 days during which the stock market was open. But as the table below shows, if you missed just the 10 best days out of those 5,000, you'd have less than half as much money. Miss the best 20 days, and you'd barely have made any money at all over 20 years, and you'd have lost money if you missed more winning days.

ImLennyBruce,"If you are bullish on QQQ this year you and you are looking for 100% profit then you could simply open a bull call spread on QQQ. For example, at close yesterday a jan 2022 315/335c was selling for 9.63. Your breakeven would be 324. So as long as QQQ ends the year up about 3.5% you don’t lose money. If QQQ ends the year up just 7% you hit max profit of $1,037. You risk $963 (+ fees) to make $1,037.

If you think 7% is pussy shit you can go further OTM. For example, 380/400 would cost $332 with max profit $1,668 for a potential 500% gain. Betting on another 30% year for QQQ is a much riskier strategy. BUT compare that to TQQQ where QQQ would probably have to move 40% for you to get a 100% gain and it starts to look pretty good.

I would buy mostly close to the money with the idea that I could buy back the short leg if/when we get a market correction. That way I can take profit on the pullback and uncap my upside.

booklips,"I'll give a quick synopsis because it can get pretty in depth when you start looking at greeks and stuff. A butterfly is just a combination of a vertical credit spread and vertical debit spread with the short strikes at the same strike. You want to collect as much premium from those short strikes while collecting as much value from the long position, so you want the price to be as close to the short strikes as possible on expiration day - that's how you make most of your money. 

Eg. XYZ is currently at $100. You think by the end of the month it'll go to $125 so you build a butterfly where you buy a $100 call, sell 2 $125 calls, and then buy one $150 call (the difference between the strikes should be the same, unless you're doing advanced strategies like a broken wing or something). If on expiration, the price is at 125, you've reached max profit. If it blows past your short strikes you're protected to the upside with the $150 call. Profit is limited, but you risk so much less money doing this strategy than just buying calls without a hedge (the short positions).

It's not a great explanation, but you can read and watch videos about it, too.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ll give a quick synopsis because it can get pretty in depth when you start looking at greeks and stuff.

booklips,"I bought the AMZN and TSLA call butterflies Wed night. Once TSLA hit 717 on Thurs and moment slowed down I bought the put butterfly with the goal of having it land between the 695 and 700 short strikes. 

When I say lotto plays it isn’t necessarily when I enter them, it’s how narrow the wings are and the risk vs reward. These were very narrow wings so a small chance of profit but they were sill extremely cheap - between 20-60 bucks per butterfly.

Regarding trend: I use an indicator called Voodoo Lines by Simpler Trading (note: I’m not employed by them or anything, I just find them to be credible in what they put out). It’s all technical analysis and Fibonacci stuff put into an indicator so you don’t have to run levels yourself. I saw 700 as a major level of resistance in Tesla based off that and built my flies on that.

For AMZN, it’s general trend is a gap up on Monday and a heavy sell of on Friday. It’s almost like clockwork for it. So I use max pain on swaggystocks to see where the most amount of options will expire worthless and structure it around there. AMZN was at like 3240, I had my short strike at 3250 because it normally doesn’t dip all the way down to it’s max pain level, just close","<div class=""md""><p>I bought the AMZN and TSLA call butterflies Wed night.

TheToxicStonkAvenger,"It's not about defunding the police, it's about taking some of their responsibilities away and having trained professionals take the job. So yes, less funding, but for specific activities. Police shouldn't be doing traffic stops, responding to domestic abuse issues, responding to the mentally challenged. The former 2 would be much better solved by social workers.

But it's easy to get people all up in arms by saying the other side doesn't want police. I bet police don't even want to do these activities tbh.

Of course I am sure a select few retards do want no police at all, but the majority just feel they are not trained to deal with certain situations which can be backed up by statistics.

SPAC_Enthusiast,"Wall of text incoming.

Traffic stops are needed and are probably the number one reason for preventing deaths just by having presence on the roads. (Example - people see police they slow down) Then number one causes of deaths here that aren’t related to some sort of illness is motor vehicle collisions that are related to speed, distracted driving, seat belt infractions and impaireds. Who is going to be dealing with impaired drivers? Lol

And if you look at the traffic stops that lead to deaths... just provide your documents, listen and have your day in court (isn’t that what they’re there for?) if you believe you were innocent of what you were given a citation for, you’re fine... however it doesn’t go that way, people start mouthing off, doing sketchy shit and resist arrest) I mean I’m no genius but given how the media has already vilified police, shouldn’t you just theoretically shut your mouth and listen? It’s worked for me and everyone I know in person. Not sure why people have such an issue over in the US.

Simple Traffic stops for speeding or other minor offences also lead to majority of all illegal firearms, sex trafficking, abductions, wanted fugitives and drugs being trafficked that get taken off the road.  Nobody cares about this or talks about this because they’re uneducated and don’t actually know what goes on in their closed doors, lol.

I also don’t think a social worker responding to a domestic incident is a great idea. An active in progress domestic involving a violent offender with a weapon that has beaten the shit out of their partner and children involved, not really sure how a social worker is remotely equipped to deal with that. They come in AFTER the police are there and have defused the situation. Every single call is different and fluid, can’t say they shouldn’t be going to each and every call, mental health crisis workers attend calls with police here if it’s required. Sending a social worker to a house alone is retarded with a mentally unstable individual. (They’ve been killed here doing so, (police and social worker)

And honestly, the issue is the social workers I work with will refuse to go to these calls alone anyway due to the danger factor and request police - the media won’t say shit about that. Can’t set a blanket statement for every call.

Less funding = less police due to lack of staff and increased population (political stunt of defunding) 

Imagine being a call taker and saying - Sorry sir/ma’am you’re going to have to wait while your partner beats you and your children and destroys all of your property because we have nobody available at this moment.

itsleis,"You said in your post above that losing hurts and you've been fomoing into Tesla. Of course it hurts and of course you want to make that money back, it's human nature. Don't deny it, it'll hurt your trading. 

""I know"", mmm if you knew and stuck to what you know you wouldn't have lost everything you gained. That's really poor risk management. If you want to scalp, risk management is key because you legitimately cannot predict anything in minute candles. It really is like rolling a dice. The only possible thing that can save you is stop loss, 2% per trade, pulling out your profits and reinvesting only those profits. Your risk:reward should be at least 3:1 if not higher since in this casino you're very very likely to lose several times in a row and losses are far harder to recover from. 

For your sake, you should practice options on a paper trading account first. Investopedia has a free trading simulator where you're able to trade options. Too boring for you? Might as well just donate the money you want to gamble on to charity, then. You really will lose most of it without proper psychology and a strategy in place and it takes years to become profitable.

This may still target innocent people, or be easy to bypass by simply writing the odd comment between pumps. Additionally tracking things like 🚀G🚀M🚀E🚀! Would also pass this, then you need some funky regex patterns.   
  
Then you start getting into tickers that are apart of words or stand alone words, like FUSE, or AHH which could false trigger.  
  
In your example when there's an influx, that could have many catalysts, imagine getting flagged for talking about AAPL because they declared they have an EV, so they are declared them pumpers.

<p>This may still target innocent people, or be easy to bypass by simply writing the odd comment between pumps. Additionally tracking things like 🚀G🚀M🚀E🚀! Would also pass this, then you need some funky regex patterns.   </p>

<p>Then you start getting into tickers that are apart of words or stand alone words, like FUSE, or AHH which could false trigger.  </p>

<p>In your example when there&#39;s an influx, that could have many catalysts, imagine getting flagged for talking about AAPL because they declared they have an EV, so they are declared them pumpers. But the catalyst was legitimate news. Or PLTR gets a new contract, then temp banning everyone who mentions it. Doesn&#39;t work.</p>

this is why it's a fine line about what you think the stock can move in a week to maximize theta gains. one way is to wait till monday to see where the price opens, rather than sell the call the previous friday and keep guessing all weekend if that's the right strike u sold. see what works!","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah I sell calls expiring weekly. so for example in TSLA if your leap is 600c and you sell weekly 700c, and TSLA hits close to 700 by friday, just close your entire position for a net profit, your leap will have a higher delta till the price of TSLA is below 700. once it starts shooting up even higher, the weekly will outpace the leap. </p>
