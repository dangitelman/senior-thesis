namsilat,"A couple of things.  Maybe I can help.

In 09, housing cratered.  It was really fucking bad news for everyone, at first.

But then big money found out that their losses were going to be offset by taxpayers.  So they took the money, and bought real estate like motherfuckers.  Poor people, people with bad fico scores, and people on fixed income lost everything.  Housing rebounded, and the rich got way fucking richer.

Now, the same thing is happening, but to small business for very different reasons.  Mom and pops everywhere are going or gone.  And the big fucks, who’s losses are being bought up at the expense of the monetary well being of future generations, are going to win big.  Because those niches will be filled by people with capital once this is all over.

The markets don’t represent the people losing their businesses, they represent companies with enough capital, political sway, and economic clout to survive this and profit enormously from the need that will be generated by 75% of small businesses in this country going under.

fuegocossack,"Shitty Q2 estimates are probably gonna be priced in, per usual, but I think a few catalysts will make things interesting.

1- continued shit earnings in q3 - literally every economic of earnings estimate has only gotten worse from the get go, so this could surprise. A third of the S&P won't even offer guidance right now.

2- bankruptcies - the fed can make you liquid but cannot make you solvent. A bunch of overleverages companies are now further indebted and in a shittier economic environment

3- people needing their money again. When UE benefits decrease or evaporate and the white collar workers in the 100-150k range get hit? They'll withdrawal. And nobody is hedges and everyone is trading on margin, so it can move fast.

eli_lilly,"What Wino-Junko said is the basis behind what's happening. But, specifically, what I'm doing is looking at who is reporting earnings more than a week out. If I recognize the company and think it will go up, I wait for a dip in the stock price and buy monthly calls, past earnings date, slightly out of the money (aka above the current price). Make sure there is volume and open interest. If I'm right and it ramps up pre-earnings, sell before earnings (and don't look back). If it doesn't ramp pre-earnings it'll most likely ramp after. Right now, every grocery store and food producer is reporting record earnings for the ones that haven't reported yet. 

My next play will assume that earnings for Q3 will absolutely suck for some business segments (I have Q4 puts on CCL and SPG). But the calls are much easier and safer plays so I'd recommend getting better at them before doing puts on an upward market.

Also, if you've read about a specific stock on wsb for more than 2-3 days and haven't jumped on, there's a good chance you're too late so just look for the next thing.

I hate to give examples but right now I'm getting some Smuckers calls, they report earnings 6/5 premarket and I think there's still going to be upward movement. Grocery stores sold out of all their crap like penis butturd and jelly. I also picked up some BUD $50 9/19 calls, a good tip from wsb and I have seen people loading up beer at the store like never before, plus all the local craft breweries have been closed. 

There's also a really simple play that someone mentioned on WSB that seems to work. If SPY gaps down hard EOD, in that last 10 minutes, buy monthly calls. Sell them first thing when the market opens the next day.

framauro13,"What the other guy said.  It's down after hours, but one more good day and you're close to ITM, so I'd give it a couple days and if nothing happens consider pulling out by Friday.  But that's just me.  I'm trying to be much more conservative these days.

&#x200B;

Just remember that cutting losses and selling for a loss is more profitable than expiring worthless.  Everyone here loves to scream ""diamond hands"" but more often than not that just leads to more lost money.  All depends on how much faith you have in your position and how much you're willing to lose.

luvens,Buy call.  Have underlying rise.  Sell call a few strikes above for the same date/ticker.  Ideally for multiples of what you bought your call for.  If the underlying goes down otm the option you sold ( and your call) are worthless but that's OK cause you made your money already.  If it goes up more you are capping your gains but profit is guaranteed. Looking at a .01 becomes not a bad thing.  As long as it's same date ticker rh will let you do it.  It will be scare at first but you'll figure it out.  Your money moves more sideways/uppies than down.,"<div class=""md""><p>Buy call.  Have underlying rise.

TheTigersAreNotReal,"I also agree that if black communities were to be reformed then it would solve many problems that plague them. But I think you’ve provided conveniently simple solutions to a very complex problem. The biggest barrier to having a stable family structure is poverty. Now some impoverished families are capable of maintaining a stable family structure, but they are the outliers, not the norm. 

And this is true for families of any ethnicity. There’s a great book called *Hillbilly Elegy*, where the author describes his upbringing in the incredibly impoverished Appalachian communities, which are majority white communities. The decline of the coal industry has left many of them impoverished with little to no job opportunities. And the lack of financial stability left his family in constant turmoil. The same thing is evident in the black communities. Poverty and lack of opportunity has left many of their families broken. 

You claim that many of them lack motivation because of welfare handouts, and I’m willing to meet you halfway on this because I think our welfare system is severely flawed. Mainly because it’s the government’s attempt at putting a bandaid on a heavily bleeding laceration. There may be a lack of motivation, but I think it relates more to lack of opportunity. I think most humans have an inherent strive to be useful, that we are *Homo faber*, meaning that we live to work. Otherwise we waste away like an animal in a small cage. Many black people have very little job prospects available that aren’t blue collar or retail. Unfortunately [real wages for these kinds of jobs have stagnated for the past 40 years](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/), meaning that they have barely kept up with inflation. While housing prices and rent have grown much faster than inflation, leaving those with these kinds of jobs far less available useable income. Also it is significantly more difficult for people black communities to acquire loans from banks due to tactics like [redlining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), so they cannot bring in money to their communities to rebuild and promote economic growth. This also means that they are less educated on finances, and are easily preyed on by financing lenders. This is actually why black people were disproportionally affected by the 2008 housing market collapse. Because [subprime loan lenders knew that black people weren’t as educated about finances and could be easily convinced to take on loans that they couldn’t pay back](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/c56132c2-266f-3549-8c60-693fa7c84024). 

Poverty affects all areas of life. Children that grow up in poverty perform worse in school because of stress at home. If you have a community of impoverished or lower class people then the local schools have poor performance on standardized tests, which means that the school will receive less grants and funding from the government. So now you have run-down schools in communities that cannot acquire loans to inject cash into their local economy and majority low-wage jobs for which the wages haven’t risen above inflation while almost all other expenses have risen faster than inflation. Families crumble due to stress, people lash out violently or turn to drugs to keep their mind off the depressive state of affairs they were born into. Children aren’t properly raised or educated, parents are often bad role models. People turn to drug dealing and gangs to have an opportunity to make more money. And then on top of it all cops are profiling and using excessive force and violence against them.

A lot of black people see themselves in a hole with no way out, and I don’t blame them. I couldn’t imagine growing up in a community like that, only to see how easily people in middle and upper class communities go through life, not being as severely weighed down by things outside of their control. I agree white people should not be a scapegoat, but I don’t hold it against black people for conflating the systemic barriers holding them back as being a coordinated effort by white people against them. It’s the same as how some white people conflate the problems in the world as being a grand scheme orchestrated by Jews. I *do* blame far left media for encouraging this mindset and proliferating the idea that all white people are oppressors. That kind of tribalistic mindset only hurts their chances of recognizing the true problems that keep them oppressed. 

It’s very difficult to draw a line between where personal responsibility ends and historical oppression begins. On an individual level it’s easy to point out where the person should’ve made more responsible choices. But that negates the cultural, communal, and societal influences that obscure their judgement. Single family households, welfare, lack of motivation, and black on black violence are symptoms of a larger problem, not the problem itself. If I were to revise your equation, I would say that strong community + good education + equal opportunity + hard work = success. 

There’s no simple solution to fixing the problems facing black people. 

Their schools should be given proper funding, be brought into in the 21st century. When I was a sophomore in high school in 2011 everyone in my school was given a school-issued iPad and every room has a smart board. Inner-city schools are still using textbooks from the 80’s and chalkboard. But giving them more funding will piss off other schools still reliant on their test scores to receive their funding. 

There should be lending programs instituted by the government that properly educate people on the benefits and drawbacks of certain loans, and allow them to take out loans to rebuild their community themselves and drive more economic activity. This would need strong oversight to ensure there’s no misappropriation of the money, but will also require lenient interest rates and proper avenues that protect the borrowers from going bankrupt if they use the money appropriately but it still doesn’t work out. 

Black communities need to be given the tools to rebuild themselves, reinvigorate their motivation, to reform themselves. But the ultimate tool required to do this is money, and that’s why nothing is being done. They cannot get loans, they cannot get better jobs, they cannot get better education. They are trapped.

Also, although we disagree, I appreciate you being open to discuss this.
