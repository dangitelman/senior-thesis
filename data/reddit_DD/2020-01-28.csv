BlueKnightJoe,"My predictions for this week:

1. Coronavirus continues to spread at an alarming rate, however the news headlines stop caring because they have the memory and attention span of a goldfish. People regularly dying of coronavirus becomes a normal thing. People die every day and stonks don't care because they be stonkin'
2. However, stonks do care about earnings. I predict that most earnings *will* beat on revenue and guidance, yet they will still go down, much to the pikachuface of bulls. Guidance will still indicate an economic slowdown and remind shareholders that their shit is overbought. Massive profit taking ensues.
3. I predict the Fed will keep rates the same, and they will express a desire to gradually lessen their repo assistance and QE, so as not to cause an equities bubble. As the extra liquidity drains away, the market will snap back to reality and ope there goes gravity.","<div class=""md""><p>My predictions for this week:</p>

People regularly dying of coronavirus becomes a normal thing. People die every day and stonks don&#39;t care because they be stonkin&#39;</li>
<li>However, stonks do care about earnings. I predict that most earnings <em>will</em> beat on revenue and guidance, yet they will still go down, much to the pikachuface of bulls. Guidance will still indicate an economic slowdown and remind shareholders that their shit is overbought. Massive profit taking ensues.</li>
<li>I predict the Fed will keep rates the same, and they will express a desire to gradually lessen their repo assistance and QE, so as not to cause an equities bubble. As the extra liquidity drains away, the market will snap back to reality and ope there goes gravity.</li>

The Good: Q4 revenue and sales absolutely will kill expectations. People could not buy enough fruit this past holiday season. AirPods were nowhere to be found, even the laptops and desktops were sold out lots of places. Anyone who didn’t already have an iWatch who wanted a tracking device also scooped one this past quarter.

The Bad: guidance will not be great, China has gone dark, no real upside from here in terms of innovation/hype until later this year.

I think IC is the way to go. 335/295 and just collect some premium if you really *need* to have money in the market on this one. 

If that’s too complicated for you and you want a simple upsies or downsies, *go with puts* because the market cares more about the future than the past and the outlook for Apple though great, will be uncertain at best in terms of trying to duplicate the Q4 EPS.

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

Hubei saw cases double in a single day. This is expected to be more of a result of limited testing availability and not necessarily acceleration (blacklogging).

Deaths now past 100 with an additional 800 considered critial, still no deaths outside of China. Hubei saw cases double in a single day. This is expected to be more of a result of limited testing availability and not necessarily acceleration (blacklogging). Air quality in China is hypothesized to play a role as it is worse than smoking daily. Combine that with what is essentially advanced Pneumonia and the critical cases make up 20% of all infected.</a></p>

Let’s say you buy a $500 call that expires on 1/31. Then, let’s say the stock hits $550 on 1/30. You have the option to sell the contract OR exercise it, correct? If you don’t have enough buying power to exercise it, you sell the contract. You still make profits even if the stock keeps going above 550 before 1/30, right?

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

OldPilot71,"Foolproof money printing method (I use a Dow derivative)

\-  Wait for a daily low point-  Buy a tiny low risk long position set stop loss level at 0.5% of your total capital-  Wait for that position to be in modest profit (e.g. 50 points up e.g.)- Set guaranteed stop loss on open position at 1 point profit- Buy another position, also tiny.- Repeat whilst market is rising, so you only ever have one position that might make a loss- After market has risen around 200-250 dow points, sel, for a profit, all but the last open position.- At this point, experience says that market has a high chance of correcting slightly and going down, if it continues up, start a new round of opening positions.

PROS

\- You only ever have one position that could lose a max of 0.5%- No trying to guess the market direction as you only go long...if it goes up, you win, if it goes down significantly or crashes, congratulations, you got yourself a whole new fresh range of cheap buying opportunities.

\-E.g. Fridays correction down to yesterdays opening values created fantastic BTD opportunities.

CONS

\- Profits are small and steady...maybe 3-6% a week growth, varying...some weeks can be frustratingly flat.- No 1000% gainz in 2hours

More PROS

\- No 95% losses in 2 hours.

With a portfolio of £20k/$20k you can make yourself a tidy monthly side income and do all those fun things you've wanted to (buy a yacht, learn to fly, travel etc.).  


You can also pay for your kids trips that cost a small fortune, but which are fantastic opportunities.  I paid for my daughters 10 day educational sailing trip with 2 days profits.","<div class=""md""><p>Foolproof money printing method (I use a Dow derivative)</p>

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

**Untested infections suspected to be 44,000. China may not be lying, but lacking equipment to test at such a scale.**



[Current case report from China ups number from 2880 to 4474 in 24 hours. Deaths now past 100 with an additional 800 considered critial, still no deaths outside of China.

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

Hubei saw cases double in a single day. This is expected to be more of a result of limited testing availability and not necessarily acceleration (blacklogging).

Deaths now past 100 with an additional 800 considered critial, still no deaths outside of China. Hubei saw cases double in a single day. This is expected to be more of a result of limited testing availability and not necessarily acceleration (blacklogging). Air quality in China is hypothesized to play a role as it is worse than smoking daily. Combine that with what is essentially advanced Pneumonia and the critical cases make up 20% of all infected.</a></p>

You are betting on a runner to finish a race by a certain time. The race not might end for a month, but in order to cross the finish line in time the runner must maintain an average of 5 miles per hour the entire race.

Today, your runner is only running at 3mph. At this rate, your runner will not cross the finish line so your chances of winning go down (aka option price drops).

You might need a stock to gain an average of 1% a day to be in the green. If it spends a day only going up .5%, you are behind schedule and option prices will drop even though the stock price is going up.

mauimikes,I’ve only done it a few times. For aapl I’m selling a call spread. Sold the 335 and bought the 340s. As long as aapl stays below 335 I’m Gucci and will collect 100% premium.

Think the payout is $1800 or so in premium but if shit goes crazy and it opens at 350 I’ll be out like $9k.

Do they just give out options to anyone nowadays??

When volatility is higher, price of options are higher because the stock has a chance to move further in either direction.

WikiTextBot,"**Twitch Plays Pokémon**

Twitch Plays Pokémon (TPP)  is a social experiment and channel on the video game live streaming website Twitch, consisting of a crowdsourced attempt to play Game Freak's and Nintendo's Pokémon video games by parsing commands sent by users through the channel's chat room. It holds the Guinness World Record for having ""the most participants on a single-player online videogame"" with 1,165,140.The concept was developed by an anonymous Australian programmer and launched on 12 February 2014, starting with the game Pokémon Red. The stream became unexpectedly popular, reaching an average concurrent viewership of over 80,000 viewers (with at least 10% participating). On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment.

GermyBones,"Yeah it's an earnings play, but my justifications are as follows.

1) that the corporate turnaround under Culp should be displayed if they beat profitability estimates.
