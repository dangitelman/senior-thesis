NukeMagnet,"What do you guys think of Platinum vs Palladium vs Gold? 

For Gold:

Pros -

- Used as money for entire human history

- Fed printing money makes gold worth more (this is true for all assets)

- Basically correlated with fear

- Can buy Calls (huge plus)

- Not very volatile

- Still off its highs

Cons:

- Not comparably useful (industrially) to other PGMs

- Less fear = Lower gold price (soothing words make my calls hurt)

- Gold bugs very retarded mostly (ron paul)

- boring (but less so than others because calls)

For Platinum


Pros:

- Way off its highs, seems to have found a bottom with QE4

- Just as industrially useful as Palladium (in some ways, moreso)

- More useful than gold

- Historically low price relative to other metals (especially palladium)

- Actually much rarer than Palladium (roughly 3-4x rare IIRC)

- Autocatalyst demand tends to switch between two metal

- Investment demand has largest drop last year, could rebound

- Money printing make assets go up (could end soon tho)

Cons:

- Chart not as bullish as Palladium

- Deisel cars use mostly PT catalyst, large drop in demand for them

- Platinum not as desirable as Palladium for some jewelry (denser, less lustrous)

- Has better/less risky supply than Palladium (more mines produce it)

- Boring and no options this time

Palladium

Pros:

- Most bullish chart (insanely bullish)

- Demand skyrocketing due to lack of supply issues (mine closures) and increase in gas autocatalyst demand from china

- The most useful industrially for gasoline autocatalyst (but there is a point when costs will outweigh this)

- Very high demand for use in jewelry 

- Correlated with Gold/ FED money printing helps

Cons:

- You aren't gonna buy the dip here

- When the price outweighs the benefits of using platinum, autocatalyst demand will switch (but this takes time)

- Very subject to mine openings/closures or new supply discoveries

- Palladium is less rare than gold or Platinum (in earth's crust)

- Boring","<div class=""md""><p>What do you guys think of Platinum vs Palladium vs Gold? </p>

<li><p>Not comparably useful (industrially) to other PGMs</p></li>
<li><p>Less fear = Lower gold price (soothing words make my calls hurt)</p></li>
<li><p>Gold bugs very retarded mostly (ron paul)</p></li>
<li><p>boring (but less so than others because calls)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For Platinum</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Way off its highs, seems to have found a bottom with QE4</p></li>
<li><p>Just as industrially useful as Palladium (in some ways, moreso)</p></li>
<li><p>More useful than gold</p></li>
<li><p>Historically low price relative to other metals (especially palladium)</p></li>
<li><p>Actually much rarer than Palladium (roughly 3-4x rare IIRC)</p></li>
<li><p>Autocatalyst demand tends to switch between two metal</p></li>
<li><p>Investment demand has largest drop last year, could rebound</p></li>
<li><p>Money printing make assets go up (could end soon tho)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chart not as bullish as Palladium</p></li>
<li><p>Deisel cars use mostly PT catalyst, large drop in demand for them</p></li>
<li><p>Platinum not as desirable as Palladium for some jewelry (denser, less lustrous)</p></li>
<li><p>Has better/less risky supply than Palladium (more mines produce it)</p></li>
<li><p>Boring and no options this time</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Palladium</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most bullish chart (insanely bullish)</p></li>
<li><p>Demand skyrocketing due to lack of supply issues (mine closures) and increase in gas autocatalyst demand from china</p></li>
<li><p>The most useful industrially for gasoline autocatalyst (but there is a point when costs will outweigh this)</p></li>
<li><p>Very high demand for use in jewelry </p></li>
<li><p>Correlated with Gold/ FED money printing helps</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You aren&#39;t gonna buy the dip here</p></li>
<li><p>When the price outweighs the benefits of using platinum, autocatalyst demand will switch (but this takes time)</p></li>
<li><p>Very subject to mine openings/closures or new supply discoveries</p></li>
<li><p>Palladium is less rare than gold or Platinum (in earth&#39;s crust)</p></li>
<li><p>Boring</p></li>
</ul>

TimAppleBurner,"Think about it this way: 

Iran wants to come off as some hardcore extremist badass military that will fuck over anyone that tries to fuck with us. You kill our general???! WE WILL DESTROY YOUR MILITARY BASE. 

But here’s what actually happened: we precision strike their general, they retaliate by shooting up an evacuated base. They know there will be hell to pay if it wasn’t. They are edging themselves so hard that they think a plane is coming to attack them and they prematurely ejaculate and blow up the commercial jet by mistake. 

Imagine trying to give the impression to everyone that you are a bunch of highly trained badasses and how embarrassing it must be to accidentally shoot down a commercial plane? I know it’s incredibly sad, but not from a tragedy standpoint, but a perception standpoint. You suck so badly that you SAM a commercial jet out of the sky, and then have to lie to the world about what happened. But the world is literally laughing at you in your stupidity.

,"My autism kicked in this weekend and I created a dynamically adjusting portfolio based on comment volumes from this underground lair. The first draft gathered data from 12/16 to 12/23 and calculated returns from 12/24 to 1/12. The general sentiment was bullish so it went long. 

Somehow this sub generated a meme alpha of 3.8% over that period. This historic bull run has truly led to a meme economy. Probably not what we need but truly what we deserve. I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like if we ever have a red week. God speed you beautiful bastards.

galactictaco42,"so what if existence is meant to be painful?

like we get hooked on drugs like caffeine, nicotine, heroine, cocaine and all that, even like...chocolate and sugar and fats and stuff right, because the experience of not having them is physically painful. literal withdrawal symptoms from coffee and high fructose cornsyrup like you get from heroine or cocaine. 

but like, if that means chocolate and coffee are equal in effect to heroine, then like, really we are just talking about dopamine flooding the brain as a reward for achieving the thing. so our physical material existence hinges on constant inflows of this chemical, or else pain.

existence *is* pain, and anyone who says different is selling something.

enter religion. ancient gnostic christians believed the physical world to literally *be* hell. we see this today in many fundamentalist churches. when satan is cast into hell, it isnt some underground hellfire, its fucking wisconsin. its jersey. its the land of the living. the cursed. the damned. the forever tormented by the temptation of sin, the sting of pain, the fear of death. and his role on earth is to convince humanity to turn from god. to embrace the material world as being all that matters.

so shit like the catholic church *intentionally* brings about the scientific revolution (hear me out) in order to literally kill god in the eyes of men. what if they want us to eat pork *because* is tastes like human flesh. when you eat pork, according to cannibals, youre eating the closest to human flavored meat available. what if this is intentional. 

every sunday you engage in ritual human sacrifice, eating the flesh of christ, drinking his blood. then you go eat bacon cause you aint no fuckin jew and really youre eating symbolic human flesh. then you pop on some tunes and its Drake selling you #Blessed as tho blessings are physical things you can fucking commoditize and sell over the airwaves. its all one big giant fucking scam. to convince you to never even consider turning*towards* god, let alone convincing you to ever turn away.

but this is where it gets crazy right?

what if its all a complete misinterpretation of ancient alien technology, but that the ancient aliens, are dinosaurs. cause why fuck with earth? why organize humans into a civilization by giving us math and language and agriculture? why force us down a path of fucking *choosing* climate change as a necessary evil, returning our atmosphere to fucking *dinosaur times levels of CO2*?

they want to come home guys. this is why they are cros breeding with humans when they abduct us. because they want humans to upload their minds to AI and enjoy what they have. 

reptiles and the bird like ancestors of dinos dont age. they grow forever. it takes 25 years to be the size of a full grown elephant, and its the size of a fucking baby dinosaur bro. them fuckers were *anciennnnntttttt* my guys. if an intelligent dino evolved, it likely lived for as long as it had access to enough calories to maintain its size. *maybe* they had cancer, but they sure as fuck had to be at least as long lived as tortoises if not more long lived.

so they literally can cure our curse of mammalian flesh. they *are* the lizard people. thats what they are selling us. some ancient dino tech was found, we signlaed home base, they come over, meet us in the 1940's and ever since we are down some rabbit hole towards advanced AI, human merger with said AI, and permanent alterations of our atmosphere to a time when dinosaurs roamed the earth.

analyst_84,"At the 1815 Battle of Waterloo, Rothschild couriers were able to deliver news of the British victory to Nathan a full day ahead of government messengers. Nathan bought bonds at a low price that was fluctuating with uncertainty, and did very well the next day when official news came and prices rose. The conspiracy theory version states that Nathan first dumped bonds on the market to fool other investors into thinking he had news that the battle was lost, and through this ruse, multiplied the family fortune. In fact there is no historical record of this prior to a 1940 German movie called Die Rothschilds Aktien auf Waterloo, described as ""the Third Reich's first anti-Semitic manifesto on film.""

mechtech,"> Should I sell calls at a higher strike to get some money back?

This is fallacious reasoning for a trader. Each trade is an independent event. There is no ""get some money back"". You have lost it due to poor decisions. Your strike and expiration date gave you a near 100% chance to see a near linear decay of premium, and furthermore it will be a near worthless option days before the expiration date in most scenarios due to how OTM options decay.

If you would not sell calls further out in a scenario where you did not put on the original trade that you're talking about, then you should not sell options further out in a scenario where you put the trade on.

WikiTextBot,"**Generation X**

Generation X (or Gen X) is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers and preceding the Millennials. Researchers and popular media typically use birth years around 1965 to 1980 to define Generation Xers, although some sources use birth years beginning as early as 1960 and ending somewhere from 1977 to 1984. 

Gen Xers were children during a time of shifting societal values and as children were sometimes called the ""latchkey generation"", due to reduced adult supervision as children compared to previous generations, a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home. As adolescents and young adults, they were dubbed the ""MTV Generation"" (a reference to the music video channel).

I’ve literally shipped shit that had yet to be machined that’s worth over 800k... one fucking part. It’s amazing how expensive some of this shit is.

There are guys who get paid a shit ton more then I do to just watch a machine laser scan parts. They just pull up the file and press start.

LehmanParty,"Personal preference. I feel like I grasp their movements a little better because they have less moving parts than gold itself. Gold is like a hybrid forex/commodity/interest rate/sentiment play, and gold mines are more concentrated on the interest rates portion.

For selling premium on a week-to-week basis and skipping fed weeks I'm basically betting rate outlooks won't change without officially announced intervention. Edit: my other reason is I don't have much capital to work with for a few months and want to wheel in case things turn south; mines have more IV packed in them.","<div class=""md""><p>Personal preference.

Kristoloy,"germany does do pretty well with a mix of private insurance and government insurance. i'm not sure what their costs look like though. 

what we're trying to do right now is work on programs for people who are eligible for medicare+medicaid, which incentivizes organizations when they keep people out of the hospital. we're trying to look at the most expensive groups of people and covering them through the government - i think we're on the right track, but i dont think we'll get it figured out in time. 

we're slowly seeing a greater focus on primary care versus emergency care in america, which is what allows other countries to keep lower costs - they keep their citizens healthier. i think if we continue that focus and set governmental limits on medical equipment and healthcare service costs then we'll be good. 

recently, hospitals were required to publish their charges for services - that was a good first step, but this doesn't do much by itself. the next step we took was requiring health orgs to publish the amount that they're reimbursed by insurance companies by 2021.

However, if it does have enough momentum, we will see a large pull back like the one in August 2019</p>
