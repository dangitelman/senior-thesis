Nix14085,"Think of options as independent things you can buy and sell. If you sell one to someone, then buy that same one later you are effectively cancelling out your initial sale. So if you buy a call for $50 then sell it for $10 you lose $40 but If you sell a call for $50 then buy it back for $10 you make a $40 profit. 

Most options aren’t exercised until the last week because the premium is generally greater than the actual value of the stock. For example if a stock is at $20 and you have a $19 call that call is likely worth more than $1 per share because the stock could still go higher and thus the value would increase. Therefore you would make more money by simply selling the option itself rather then exercising the contract.","<div class=""md""><p>Think of options as independent things you can buy and sell.

50Asperger_60Dumb,"it will happen, but idk when. Of course the is the possibility that stock markets is right, that is the only place to have some yield in the future when yields are gonna be really lo for really long. But idk, markets are so irrational at extremes that me thinks were going to bow this up at some point, and have another cycle with good yields again. 

I might be wrong, but usually the curve inverts something like 1-2 years prior. But inversion isn't the signal. I think its the rapid re-steepening, where looser policy is in place also?

I think credit spreads widening is the warning to look for. It might, or might not happen quite rapidly. 

The funny thing is stock markets usually have its best returns prior recessions, after the curve has inverted. and during recessions after market corrections. 

The whole stock market acts kinda good leading indicator during recessions that things will get better.

LVXSIT,"Hmmm. I agree that I should be more careful when talking about likelihood,  but I'm not understanding the last part.

Right now I'm holding a SPY 1/21 328c which was $405 at close. At this point the premium basically only covers the difference between $328 and SPY's $331.95 close price.

The delta is 0.83 but I'll probably actually make $100 if SPY goes up to $333 tomorrow. That may or may not happen, but at most it is an extra 20% gain right?

But if I buy a call out in February for $100 (337c 2/07 for example) I'm looking at a delta of 0.25 at least, plus the extra acceleration I'm getting from gamma. So instead of 20% I'm getting 25%.

Am I missing something?","<div class=""md""><p>Hmmm. I agree that I should be more careful when talking about likelihood,  but I&#39;m not understanding the last part.</p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m holding a SPY 1/21 328c which was $405 at close. At this point the premium basically only covers the difference between $328 and SPY&#39;s $331.95 close price.</p>

<p>The delta is 0.83 but I&#39;ll probably actually make $100 if SPY goes up to $333 tomorrow. That may or may not happen, but at most it is an extra 20% gain right?</p>

<p>But if I buy a call out in February for $100 (337c 2/07 for example) I&#39;m looking at a delta of 0.25 at least, plus the extra acceleration I&#39;m getting from gamma. So instead of 20% I&#39;m getting 25%.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
