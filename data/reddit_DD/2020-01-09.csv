i started trading with 250 bucks last year when your stock was at $140. i worked a shit job in my major and i put $20 into my account every paycheck. since i'm completely an autist, i made 250 into 1k. 1k into 2k. 2k into 4k. and here we are a year later, 250 to 9k. 

daddy elon: yesterday i did a dumb. when your daddy strong stock was going back and forth between 498 and 495, i bought my first Big Boy Call at 97.5. then the stock adjusted to 989. because, again i'm a fucking autist, i didn't lose the full 350. but that's the first time i've lost more than 115 in a day. i'm sure my fellow autists think that's a super cute statement but 250 to 9k is a rags to bitches story. my RH ain't red much.

daddy elon. please use your Strong Daddy powers. because every fucking cent this dipshit stock we're all riding the dick of goes up? i get like 12 bucks. 

i've been a good boy this year and santa brought me new brakes for my car but my tires are bald. daddy elon, i don't want to die in a car crash. but the ""black, round, holds air"" option for tires starts at 350. 

daddy elon. i have one late christmas wish. every day for almost the entire last 365 -- i've checked my account at 9:30 and you've sprayed thick wads of tendies all over me. sometimes i'm at work when you do it and it's super embarrassing but i'm still proud when i walk out for a smoke covered in your tendies. i made a Big Boy bet. just like you'd want me to: when i was financially stable enough to be able to take a 1k loss. and i am. 

but daddy elon. i'm not going to take a 1k loss. and i want you to spray me so god damned hard in tendies that i can't fucking move. 

also hey congrats on your bby. between you and grimes that kid is going to be emotionally detached as fuck but also rich af.

<p>daddy elon. please use your Strong Daddy powers. because every fucking cent this dipshit stock we&#39;re all riding the dick of goes up? i get like 12 bucks. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve been a good boy this year and santa brought me new brakes for my car but my tires are bald. daddy elon, i don&#39;t want to die in a car crash. but the &quot;black, round, holds air&quot; option for tires starts at 350. </p>

<p>daddy elon. i have one late christmas wish. every day for almost the entire last 365 -- i&#39;ve checked my account at 9:30 and you&#39;ve sprayed thick wads of tendies all over me. sometimes i&#39;m at work when you do it and it&#39;s super embarrassing but i&#39;m still proud when i walk out for a smoke covered in your tendies. i made a Big Boy bet. just like you&#39;d want me to: when i was financially stable enough to be able to take a 1k loss. and i am. </p>

<p>but daddy elon. i&#39;m not going to take a 1k loss. and i want you to spray me so god damned hard in tendies that i can&#39;t fucking move. </p>

<p>also hey congrats on your bby. between you and grimes that kid is going to be emotionally detached as fuck but also rich af.</p>

President Donald Trump may not reach the second part of a trade pact with China until after the 2020 election, he said Thursday. 

The president said his administration will start “right away” negotiating the next piece of an agreement after striking a so-called phase one deal. But he said “it’ll take a little time” to finish an accord, and suggested he could have more leverage after his reelection bid in November. 

“I think I might want to wait to finish ’til after the election, because by doing that, I think we can actually make a little bit better deal, maybe a lot better deal,” Trump told reporters at the White House. ","<div class=""md""><p>Subtle dump and pump next week</p>

mydogsnameisreggie,"Hey guys just wanted to remind everyone I bought $170,000 of 3X Spy ETF in the depths of the great recession. I have enormous balls so I held for a decade. Unfortunately those balls hang out of my vagina. I have weak hands so I started to sell. I'm richer than you. Moving forward I have a series of hard stops in place that will engage the stretching of my vagina each time one is activated. I anticipate fitting three 8"" cocks in my vagina by this time next year. And it doesn't make a difference when I sell because I make alot of money. And I don't mind giving 1/4 to this great nation. Pretty good payday if I say so myself. What does it feel like to pleasure a woman? My mom says she's proud of me but I feel like there's more to life than pleasing mother. Anyway guys, keep up the good work with those option things. When all of my hard stops are hit I plan to experiment with those things with all of my winnings.","<div class=""md""><p>Hey guys just wanted to remind everyone I bought $170,000 of 3X Spy ETF in the depths of the great recession.

There's a gap left to 296.59 tho so it might visit that area first but that'd be another 2.5% downside. Next big volume area is 290 but again that's way too low point of entry for a technical move like that.

WikiTextBot,"**Iran Air Flight 655**

Iran Air Flight 655 was a scheduled passenger flight from Tehran to Dubai via Bandar Abbas, that was shot down on 3 July 1988 by an SM-2MR surface-to-air missile fired from USS Vincennes, a guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy. The aircraft, an Airbus A300, was destroyed and all 290 people on board, including 66 children, were killed. The jet was hit while flying over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, along the flight's usual route, shortly after departing Bandar Abbas International Airport, the flight's stopover location. Vincennes had entered Iranian territory after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits.The reason for the shootdown has been disputed between the governments of the two countries.

FredWeedMax,"Because at the time the outlook wasn't very bright (late august) and i simply rerolled my 135C that gained me a lot during the july rally into higher strikes with longer expiration thinking gold would continue to rally to 1600 without interruption

Turns out i bought these calls very shortly after the 1550 spike and got screwed bad. Lost like 30% in matter of days, then i opened up a spread and made a few thousand bucks on the downside but got too scared of losing profits from the spread because i was so sure it would slingshot back up after testing 1460, and it kinda did but only hit 1520 and i was way underwater even with leaps (since my avg was 1540/1550 and 150 GLD is basically 1630 spot)

Turns out i shoulda just held what i had in my account around that time instead of doubling down on gold calls, mostly msft aapl and mcd leaps, the mcd woulda turn badly but aapl and msft wouldve killed it

Oh btw i hold similar silver calls (17, 18 20 SLV calls), the whole account is fucked, i shoulda manage all that but simply decided to turn a blind eye.
