trumpasaurus_erectus,"How many of you tards actually play calendar spreads? If you do two legs, they print money.

**EDIT:** Ok, so this is how it works. You find a stock with ridiculous option premium, like, say, NFLX. You're pretty sure NFLX won't move outside of a +/- $10 window from it's current price *in one week's time*. So you open the trade like this. Say the price is $100. You sell one $110 call exp on the next Friday, one $90 put with the same exp and then you **buy** the same strikes for the same type of options that exp the following Friday.  This is a net debit to enter this trade. You exit the trade no later than Thursday or Friday for the current week. This is especially profitable for ER's. You're profiting off of theta and IV in the case of earnings.  If you place your strikes right, it won't even matter if the strikes you sold go ITM. Key thing to ensure is that you look at optionsprofitcalc and adjust your strike windows accordingly. This obviously won't work with every ticker, but I only had $500 to play with this week and I will close today or tomorrow with a $1000 profit.","<div class=""md""><p>How many of you tards actually play calendar spreads?

Then panic and go /full fucking autist/ and place 10 FD calls on SVXY when it hit its low of 67 crossing your fingers that the Volitility of the market would burn off the VIX later in the day.</p>

<p>10x sold for 440. Those options are now worth 1200 but I only have one day trade left so I guess I&#39;m going to go full retard and hold them overnight since the strike is already passed and they&#39;re around 0.10 from breakeven.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to probably regret the fuck out of this. But hey, got some cheap Visa at the bottom.</p>

trumpasaurus_erectus,"Just saw this. So you profit off of the short legs in the first week, while protecting yourself with the long legs at a later date. I got a 125% return on NFLX last week with this strategy. After the ER, IV crush kicks in and between that and theta, the short legs are worth only a fraction of what you sold them at. The long legs are still ok though. They are also worth less, but retain much more value since they aren't really hit by theta yet. Overall, you enter for a net debit, but the value you get from the shorts is much greater than the value you lose with the longs.  Keep in mind, you NEVER have to hold options until they expire. There are times when it's good to do that, but for this strategy it's probably not a good idea although there is profit potential letting the shorts expire.","<div class=""md""><p>Just saw this.
