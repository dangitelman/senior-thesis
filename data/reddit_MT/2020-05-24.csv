Euro zone is on the verge of fracturing with a banking system that makes us during 2008 seem sane. Emerging markets is completely and utterly fucked for the next 10 years due to capital outflows, global trade shrinking before covid and many countries such as Mexico and Brazil were already in recession.

We ended 295 last week and I think we could see 300 soon. The question is, will there be selling pressure? I don’t think there will. 

Remember, investors right now are fighting for the best deal. Most of them think we’ll be back at $SPY 350 by the end of next year at the latest, so they’ll all just fighting for the cheapest deals possible.

I think that we’ll continue to see big money holding onto and only adding to their positions. This could possible cause us to reach $300 end of week and $310 end of month. It seems that every time an investor gets weak hands big money fights to swoop it up, I think this pattern will persist.

RPMayhem," 

Ford vs. Tesla 

The Past is fighting for The Future. In 2020, Oil has crashed to unprecedented levels. Demand is halted to near zero as the world population reels from a painful virus infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. Many companies had just finished recovering from the damage of 2007-09 crisis. Not to mention the tariff talks and 2018 trade talks dump. Then a Trump Pump making a V recovery. Now as of writing it’s 5/24/2020. It’s raining as Tiger Woods plays with Peyton Manning against Phil Mck and Tom Brady in what feels like the only real sports in what feels like years but know its only been months. Being addicted to fantasy football has me withdrawn for the competition and drive for first. (I think tiger’s going to win because of home field advantage \[13th hole guess 7:11PM\]). I digress as you’re probably asking what this has to do with ford versus tesla. Well it’s a testament and challenge for the ruler of the American roads. The American heart lies within a big burly ford raptor truck. Which it’s sales and resale strength shows it’s the holo truck that every f150 owner hopes to be. Not to mention the only thing to challenge a raptor till the cybertruck was the srt10 dodge truck super bee. So why is the all-electric car wind up toy gimmick truck challenging these titans of engineering? Because it suppers on innovation into new markets. Telsa has shown with its sell-out after sellout of tesla offerings that its found the market for electric futurists. Ford, Chevy, and every other car company ignored them for years up until now. Ford is going to throw its most predigest hat into the circle with the Mustang Mach E. MME seems to me to be an amalgamation of all data and research ever done at ford and mixed into a bowl to make this 4 door fasthatchback all-electric all-wheel drive 0-60 sub 3.5 sec 300+ miles per charge, mustang…… there isn’t a keyword you could miss on that one. Except for the v8. The heart and soul that has driven America around for over 150+ years. Now Ford is saying it’s time for a change. Ford is betting its American Sports Car Coupe on this endeavor. See this is the big gamble that I think ford is betting on. I believe that Ford knows how desirable and undersupplied the market is for pure form all-electric fast vehicles. Ford will eliminate the time entry of individuals willing to make the switch today but are put on a waitlist instead. People in our day and age want things the next day (AKA Amazon). Any amount of time spent is time wasted mentally until the reward is introduced. Longer waitlists and wait times are causing concern and confusion among potential go greeners. So to sum it all up Ford being 5.65 is criminally low for the amount of history and being the first American big wig car company to put its chips in the pile. It’s only competition is the slow out the plant Tesla. Fords’s plan to flood the market could be one that works but many small side competitors are popping up all over so it remains to be seen if this new mustang heart will be the new heart for other vehicles as well. What would a ford electric truck look like? The bronco is taking a long time. What are the odds they’re looking at the cybertruck and wondering if they should make the bronco electric as well. IMHO that’d be sick and an untapped jeepish part of the market they could dominate in. (The weather is clearing up on the 16th and the score is nearly even)","<div class=""md""><p>Ford vs. Tesla </p>

100mcg of Purified SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus. You can find this easily at water parks of states that opened prematurely.

1.5mg of Alum, or other highly soluable aluminum ion contributing salt

5mL Isotonic to human body Saline solution

Mix ingredients in a food saver package, taking care to not get any on yourself, because you'll get Coronavirus. PPE Is recommended for first time mixers! Then, sous vide mixture at 132f for 6 hours, achieving medium. Let stand until body temperature or less. Then, promptly inject subcutaneously and enjoy.

Senseisntsocommon,"If you are betting on US legalization you are stuck dealing with a bunch of OTC traded shit on US companies since none are listed on major indexes.

If you are looking at Canadian LPs with US exposure Canopy is likely first because of constellation relationship and the Acreage deal even if the Acreage deal is an absolute ripoff for Canopy at this point but it would give them a huge instant US presence.

Second would probably be CRON due to the Altria relationship but CRON is closed to biotech than actual weed and has very little in real revenue.

Third is now likely ACB with their CBD deal as that gives them a distribution network into the US.

With the recent run up the past 10 days everything is a bit on the pricier side and you could just as easily end up with 8k in a month investing in pot stocks.  Then again If Canopy crushes earnings you might have 20k this Friday as well.

Of course the answer to why has two parts

1) They kind of rushed the Michael+Holly escape in just the right amount of time to make it okay. Slamming a wedding on top would feel WAY too fast for the audience if the storyline didn't already feel too fast

I am at an institution that saw > 3000 covid hospitalizations over the two peak months.

btw saw in your comment hx (took a quick peek) you mention tamiflu. tamiflu is a straight up meme in medicine and no one worth their salt prescribes it because they want to - you'll find urgent cares handing out like candy but in reality most academic centers do not prescribe it unless you are young, old, or immunocompromised (and that's only because of fda mandated data... ugh). a one day reduction in flu-like symptoms with a great increase in nausea risk.

,"Alright. Here goes nothing.

Ingredients:
Grape seed oil (I'll get to how much later)

1 to 1.1ish Cup of all purpose white flour

1 pound of smoked sausage (good sausage makes a big difference) 

3 pounds of boneless chicken thighs

Celery, bellpepper, onions, jalapeños, garlic (I'll get the exact measurements tomorrow, don't know them off the top of my head)

2 cups of dark amber beer

Chicken stock (again, don't know the exact)

Red (cayenne) pepper to taste

Salt to taste (probably around 1.5 tbsp)

Teaspoon of grounded thyme

6ish bayeleaves 

Hotsauce (preferably Louisiana) ((can use vinegar if needed)



Start with chopping all vegetables and have them ready to go. You'll want to separate the garlic and jalapeños from the rest as they burn easy). Put salt on the vegetables as it'll help them wilt faster ((plus I'm a big believer in seasoning at each step))

Pat down the chicken with paper towels so it browns better, get a little grapeseed oil (1 tbsp) and coat the chicken in it. season both sides of the chicken with black pepper, salt and Paul prudunes MEAT magic if you can find it

In a non-glass pan(s) broil it on high for maybe 8-10 minutes on each side (it'll depend on your oven, basically you just want it brown (but not too brown (i.e. dark))

Once its done, remove the chicken,, and take maybe like a teaspoon of beer and deglaze the pan, and scrape up all of dem goodies and put the pan drippings in a bowl or some shit for later

Next is the roux which is really the only challenging part of the gumbo. Not really hard but kinda easy to mess up.. I'll link a video of my friend who gave me the original recipe (he's a cool guy) (my recipe differs from his and everyone I know likes mine slightly better but don't tell him lol) he can show you how he does the roux.

Basically tho. You get maybe .9 cups of Grapeseed oil and  heat it up until it starts to smoke (you might need to get on eye level with it to see the smoke). Right when it starts to smoke lower the temp to maybe mediumish and pour in the 1 cup of flour. Get a good wooden spoon and start stirring immediately (be sure to get the whole surface area of the bottom part of the pot) it'll turn a light brown pretty damn fast. Keep stirring. Like don't ever stop stirring. If it starts to smoke a little too much, take it off the fire and keep stirring. At first the flour might clump up and you'll think its ruined, its actually fine. It'll turn into a nice consistent paste eventually. So here's the most important thing when it comes to cooking gumbo, you want the roux as dark as possible but if you burn it, its ruined. It'll take time to master but basically go for like a darker chocolate color. It might start turning red after that (which is good). But a darker chocolate color is a good starting point that you can play around with later. This might take anywhere from 15-25 minutes depending on how high of heat. Also, if you see black flakes, it means its burnt, just let it cool, throw it out and start  again. (You'll easily know when you see black flakes because they're like pitch black in contrast to a dark brown)

One the roux is done lower the temp slightly add the vegetables (trinity). When you add the vegetables, the roux will turn dark brown to black which is fine (and good!). Stir that all together until your onions turn clearish. BTW at this point the smell is fucking amazing. (What I also do, is I save half of my onions and add them in after I add the chicken stock - it gives the gumbo a nice texture)

Now add the jalapeños followed by the garlic and bayleaves (be careful stirring the bayleaves to not break them apart). Let it cook for another couple of minutes (continue to stir the entire time)

Once the vegetables are ready, slowly add your two cups of beer and stir. Let the alcohol of the beer cook off (maybe 5-8 minutes).

Now slowly add your chicken stock (I heat mine up to prevent the roux from clumping)

At any time of this process you can start to render sausage and drain it of fat. Just cut the sausage and slowly heat it in a pan)

Now you can add the chicken, sausage, pandrippings, thyme, hotsauce, red pepper, black pepper, salt and a little meat magic if you have it. Bring it to a boil then turn it down to low to where it bubbles slowly) (tomorrow I'm going to update all of the counts) 

Cover it and let it cook on low heat for 3 hours stir it every 20ish minutes and then its ready. Add rice and green onions.


This is a rough draft that I'll update tomorrow. 

I've lived in Southwest Louisiana all my life (actual home to the best gumbo - NOT new orleans!!) And this is the best gumbo I've had. And I've had A LOT of gumbo from everywhere (its my favorite dish). It looks like a Lotta work but believe me is it worth it. Your first batch may not come out the best but it will get better and better. I think it took me like 5 batches to really perfect it. Let me know if you have any questions (sidenote please don't fucking gild this post; fuck reddit)

How early into onset were you administering the drug? Just out of curiosity. My reservations have always been with the mechanism of attack, as a replication inhibitor shouldn’t have much of an impact on a virus that can remain asymptomatic for up to 2 weeks, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the data. An average decrease of 4 days in recovery can make an impact when the concern regarding covid is hospital capacity. Early intervention is clearly paramount to the success of this thing. Nothing groundbreaking of course, but at the very least a start. I reiterate: I don’t necessarily think this drug will make an impact on outcomes per se, but I do think it may help the burden of overcapacity. Tamiflu is a meme, yes, I shit on my dad for it all the time. However, in the context of this pandemic, I think it merits a shot if we can reduce average admittance time. And once again this is coming from someone who has repeatedly bashed the practicality of this drug. 

That being said we most definitely need the 28 day follow-up before making any conclusions. Study also referenced a stunning lack of complications from the drug, less than placebo in fact, but that’s very fishy to me. 

Have you pursued other means of treatment? Anti-inflammatories or ACE2 inhibitors seem to be the best means of a treatment from what I’m seeing.

Jokes aside... Printer will only solve the liquidity problem which it is, as evident in the market ""recovery""

It can not, however solve the problem of long term debt obligations... Ie solvency...

Also statistically speaking, there are a record number of new investors entering the market which implies some of this recovery was triggered by FOMO buying.

Add in casinos being closed and you have gamblers ""investing"" in the markets as well... Which accounts for approximately 60 billion a year in the US alone.

hamplane,"yea I guess this is where the bulls and the bears diverge. I, for example, don't think lifting a lock down is fixing a very small part of the problem, the problem being the wuflu still exists in the state of a rather large outbreak (still 20k new cases a day and not falling very quickly) and we have really 3 options

1) reopen going back to business as normal. In that case, some or most people go back to their old routine, but there's a sizable portion of the population (maybe ~20-30%) made up of the actual at risk and those who are just legit scared of the virus continue to stay at home indefinitely

2) reopening with a lot of social distancing, most of the businesses in tourism, entertainment, restaurants etc top out at 70% of pre-covid revenue bc you just plain can't seat the same amount of people with 6' apart restrictions

3) The federal gov't takes the lead and rolls out very specific guidlines for an effective and safe reopening by industry that keeps covid in check and helps get businesses back up to speed, using a balanced health/economic approach that gives people effective containment practices that aren't damaging to their businesses

Obviously #3 ain't happening, so I see it as a combination of 1 & 2 depending on location, both which probably lop off enough GDP (maybe 5-8%) that easily pushes us into a solvency crisis and a prolonged recession

DrHarrisonLawrence,"Well I will acknowledge that buying puts on a stock that is in a downtrend is a successful way to profit off a stock that truly deserves to lose value; a stock that goes down 20% in a month has to go down 5% first...

But often two things happen, providing the underlying stock hasn’t changed in a material way and that the company hasn’t released defamatory news:

1) The price of the pit is higher than the day before. In some cases it has skyrocketed already if there was a 10% drop that day or something 

2) Buyers are lining up to buy the dip. So when the stock price increases, your put (that is already overly expensive) loses 20-50% value usually in a single day

If you buy puts the day after a drop, you’re simply betting that the news which made the price drop will continue to decrease the stock price every day thereafter, but it usually doesn’t - sell offs from news releases often last 1-3 days before buying resumes, providing that the underlying stock was already in an uptrend","<div class=""md""><p>Well I will acknowledge that buying puts on a stock that is in a downtrend is a successful way to profit off a stock that truly deserves to lose value; a stock that goes down 20% in a month has to go down 5% first...</p>

So, not many people, as you claimed. Just one household.

If you did any research about the disease (and I suspect you didn't -- and Facebook pages and right-wing conspiracy message boards don't count), you'd know that the disease can be asymptomatic in some people, or cause only very mild symptoms.

If you feel inclined to learn, here's a piece that shares data on the rates of asymptomatic carriers of the disease:

cranial_pudding,"Much better, thanks. The big thing i think i credit the DMT to is my emotional recovery, a lot of my woes were caused by a long term relationship that went sour. After that trip, i was completely over it. Whatever i ""talked"" to in there got me past it. It's a 20 minute trip, sure, but i felt like i was gone for an unfathomable amount of time, completely convinced i was dead. 

That was 4 years ago now and i haven't looked back since.","<div class=""md""><p>Much better, thanks.

brunoclement,"How about this: In my opinion Trump sees his reelection as being tied to equity levels.
