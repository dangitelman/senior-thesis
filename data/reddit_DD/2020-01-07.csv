stormwillpass,"Started the 2020 trading year down five digits from naked calls on AMZN and TSLA and stuff. 

Only down about 1.5-2k right now, but the loss might be more than that with AMZN gapping up again (sold another call yesterday at open, which turned out to be a really bad move).

Getting back on track to positive though.

Gonna try to make 1-2k scalping futures today. Yesterday was 1420 net on ES and 414 net on NQ (missed out on a lot for closing early in day), so 1834. Will see how things go. If it doesn't move much, might not be able to scalp that much. So far I scalped 219.50 net on NQ overnight from a small short. Not in a rush to get green right away.

Mankowitz-,"Everyone says Powell will support the market until the election, but I'm not so sure. He has been accused of all but sucking Trump's dick in the past couple years, after he acquiesced to the ""cross currents"" manufactured by the President.

So, maybe he is motivated to give a middle finger back by sinking the market with the end of the repo interventions and/or a rate hike this year.

INTC market cap is at 261B therefor AMD will top that and reach 300B market cap by 2022 cause Su Bae likes massive market cap i heard.

AMD's current market cap is 54.12B @ 48.39, therefor to reach 300B market cap by 2022 AMD will be @ 268.08

Obviously role reversal INTC is the one that's going to 50B market cap or 11.5$/share better get your puts ready for this.

\- Mexico and South America is so inherently tied to the U.S.

\- Southeast Asia seems...super corrupt. I guess \^ that is too, though.

\- India doesn't seem like a place I want to park money

You could say the same about SQ if the market tanks it may tank too but the downside can't be as big as some others who have gained so much. Fundamentals look good and chartys have been scared but the charts recently have been good. There is very high resistance around the 60 mark and has not fallen below that. SQ also has their bank application still pending. While other fintechs pussied out SQ keeps pushing to get that approved. IF they do they will be first ones to do so and will shoot the stock to new highs.,"<div class=""md""><p>I thinks it&#39;s more that 2020 is a fresh year and this stock has potential to do what everyone else has done in 2019.

[Here's ces 2018 followed by run up to ER](https://i.imgur.com/wS1CUmh.png)

[here's ces 2019 followed by a run up to ER](https://i.imgur.com/FG6DNJZ.png)

I'm not expecting the same kind of melt up as we've already gone up a fuckton but it could very well sit around 55 before ER that's why i'm saying wait before shorting.

I don't know how big the next correction will be but we're not so far from the 20MA. In january 2018 for example SPX was 3.6% higher than 20MA.

Last pullback on dec 27 SPX was just 2.4% above it's 20MA. Nov 19 was 1.5% and we dipped 2.5% on some trade tension bullshit iirc

Sometimes the market doesn't correct itself and instead plateau at some level like in july or september.

5% correction would put us at 3080, basically spy 310 area, but we might correct from 3300 or 3400 which would then be 3200","<div class=""md""><p>Sure why not. It&#39;s entirely possible the melt up isn&#39;t supported by the earnings and we tank hard to 3000spx levels</p>
