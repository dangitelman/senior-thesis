Iran will not escalate via military attacks. They want to paint a picture of US spoiling the stability and peace, that we've had after signing the nuclear accord, by assassinating their equivalent of Colin Powell. They would welcome further escalation from US as internationally people are already quite baffled by how audacious that drone attack was.

Iran said themselves US will feel the consequences of the attack for years to come - suggesting they'll just focus on the nuclear programme. Expect ICBM tests and increased uranium enrichment activity, but NOT attacks on US allies or vessels in the gulf.

knotswag,"Happy New Year autists, and time for the first **Magical Crayons TA** of the year! Doing it early because I'll be a bit busy at work today and also because I don't expect massive movement in the market. 

We're [winding closer down to one of the support levels that would have triggered a small gap down (purple line).](https://imgur.com/rwShgEC) Whether this support can hold is something to watch going forward. In general, if we hit that support intraday we should expect a bounce up or neutral battling at that support. If we gap down past it after hours, you should expect buying to try to push it back to that same level if we don't gap too far. 

If the technical move down is to come it should be coming sooner rather than later or else buying will resume, though I will note that buying is showing signs of slowing. That sounds appropriately vague (""Golly, people will buy back in if the market doesn't crash soon! Tell us more Nostradamus!"") but just reporting the PPO and momentum directions.

A consolidation range, although a funky/imperfect looking one, is starting to form. So for now ranges are 319.5-323.8. If we break either of those I'll update the next ranges up, but for now that will be support/resistance.

I'll be keeping logs of the predictions for TA this year as frequently as possible so we can determine how full of shit crayons really are. I'll score it via directionality if any prediction is made, and ranges because ranges are always given in these posts. Good luck for the rest of the day guys and hope you all make tendies.","<div class=""md""><p>Happy New Year autists, and time for the first <strong>Magical Crayons TA</strong> of the year!

HusarzKrolowiec,"DUST + NUGT are trading kind of odd. Both stuck in a range.. I think it's a matter of going with the one that breaks out

On Sept 4th I said on this forum, you could make a case for DUST - simply because GDX was at its 2016 high. Here we are again \*almost\*. Prior to hitting that high GDX had a decent pullback in the week before, both in 2016 and august 2019. So my theory is that DUST might bounce here, and if it breaks above recent highs, I'll hop on board. After that plays out, maybe GDX takes another run at the 2016 high - at which point I'll hop on NUGT. It's also possible that NUGT is just having a short term pullback, and could take off from here and go after the 2016 high - for that to happen, it's going to have to stop it's BS pattern of gapping up huge, then fading massively into close. Today's actually an inside day for NUGT so that adds a 4th dimension if you're not lost already. Simply it's a matter of buying whichever breaks out..","<div class=""md""><p>DUST + NUGT are trading kind of odd. Both stuck in a range..

What&#39;s the best way to manage this spread (it expires 1/29). Should I just let it ride to 0 and have it act as protection at SPY=319? Should I buy back the lower leg now that I&#39;ve a profit on it, and let the other leg ride? Close them both out?</p>

UsuallylurknotToday,"No, the Iranians are the geniuses playing the long game. No wartime president has ever lost re-election. By not retaliating and acting like childish bafoons with weapons, they're able to garner/rally the support of the international community (I know, you guys don't care and america is the only country on earth) in order to cast a shadow of doubt across our reputation. By striking against a leader of a sovereign nation in another sovereign nation's territory without provocation is a violation of the law, if not a total affront to generally accepted and upheld standards of international diplomacy.  That, in addition to the fact that it wasn't even domestically sanctioned, will be humiliating for the US/Trump.

Essentially, Trump is now the guy that almost started WW3 and the Iranians had to be the adults in the room. This is a sentence nobody thought would have to be uttered, yet here we are. Between his previous scandals and the potential for war, this could be his undoing if there is no escalation.  Long-term, they can have peace/stability back and renegotiate a nuclear deal if someone else wins the 2020 election.","<div class=""md""><p>No, the Iranians are the geniuses playing the long game.

If I’m Iran, this guy literally drone striked my general out of the blue (for the most part).

,"How do you define Iran winning? They have immense internal political pressure to act. I don’t think the example of the missile attack on Israel is far fetched, similar thing actually happened during the first Gulf War. In fact, we have fought Iran directly and indirectly in the Gulf repeatedly over the last 40 years. There was Earnest Will and Nimble Archer. Iran has also attacked US/NATO ships, troops and other targets from as far back as the mid-80s to as recently as last year. So no, I don’t think Iran “wins” in the sense that they successfully destroy America or one of its regional allies eg Israel. But in reality, few military conflicts in the modern era have been “won” that way. I think Iran continues to do what they’ve been doing on a larger scale, ie attacks on US bases and general ramping up of participation in the Iraqi proxy conflict for the umpteenth millionth time. And I think that vis-a-vis risk assets, until it’s clear what will happen, we’re going to see a continued (over)reaction that has as much to do with extreme technical factors as with these geopolitical shocks.
