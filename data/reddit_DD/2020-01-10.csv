Average hourly        earnings rose 0.4% in December from November, slower than the 0.3% gain        (which was revised from 0.2%) a month earlier. The increase was below        economists&#39; expectations for 0.3% wage growth. On a year-over-year        basis, workers&#39; hourly pay rose just 2.9%, the lowest since Sept.        2018 and below an expected 3.1% rate of increase.</em></p>

ElmerFUDz,"Tell me how this can go tits up:

NLOK, which is trading at $26.35, is going to pay a special dividend of $12 to anyone that holds the stock as of Jan 23rd.

TreyATX,"It’s like ever since the invention of quantitative easing the market reacts so much differently now. It’s not necessarily the percentage gains but how we get to those percentage gains. The late 90s we had much better percentage gains with no QE. The thing now is they run it up consistently to red hot RSI‘s and then dump it in a 4 or 5 day period. And then do it over again. In the past, pre-QE you would see more of a flat wave pattern up and down within weeks to months. Giving bulls and bears the opportunity to long and short the market “kinda” equally. (always with an upward tilt) but since QE started, or honestly even algorithmic trading when it became really popular in the late 2000’s. It’s just different now, the charts look like cliffs instead of hills now. If you understand what I’m talking about. So we’re going to have another incident like Jan 2018 at some point.

_elroy,"that's because people familiar with geo-politics can see that the Iranian response would have to be something small scale like what we ended up seeing. They wouldn't be backed by any NATO allies if a war began and they would be crushed if they started a full war with us alone. Iran was about to over throw it's government, so they needed something to bring the country together in terms of response, so they called up the US and said ""we gotta lob some rockets over there m8, get your bois out"", lobbed said rockets, and everything was supposed to be fine after that. 

I asked a few people I know in political circles and they all said it appeared to be a bunch of noise and nothing else. That was until the Iranians fucked it all up by accidentally blowing up a 737.

,"Well it’s just ROKU is overvalued af. Realistically their high growth rate will decline as we’re already seeing. Competition is ramping up on all fronts and that will continue to bit into their margins. 



Alright so here is my less simplified thesis. Roku was the second to last stock I got added to my PM’s portfolio at my last job almost exactly a year ago. Back then I wrote that the intrinsic value was $58 and trading far below. Adjusting that same model for today, it’s worth between $63-64 if the assumptions continue to hold true. I’m expecting slow margin expansion since they’re fighting to maintain their lead in streaming devices. I think they can do it, but that isn’t $100 worth to own now, let alone $130. Investors are realizing this now so they’re taking gains. It only got so high because of speculators, and to have owned a stock that speculators bid up is pure luck so it’s best to sell while the price is stupid high. 

Best case: the company has potential to carve a strong niche in the streaming market. Worst case: Amazon, Apple, and Google dramatically reduce prices to undercut them and they go bankrupt. Middle case: they get acquired by a competitor (unlikely at this price). 

Now, the ultra bull case sees current growth rates being maintained. Well if that’s the case, the stock is worth no more than $89. That’s pretty freaking good if you bought in the high $20s. 

If you want to make a quick buck on ROKU calls, you can, but it’s not going to deliver crazy good returns at this price unless speculators decide to play hot potato again. That’s blind luck and they rarely do the same stock twice","<div class=""md""><p>Well it’s just ROKU is overvalued af. Realistically their high growth rate will decline as we’re already seeing.

I saw it finally had good earnings. 

I saw it was going up healthily. 

I was buying dips and trying to get about 7-10 out on the dips. 

Playing 2.50 spreads I just climbed the ladder with it if it dipped once and dipped back down to give me $100 credit giving me a $150 risk I would pull the trigger. 

Like I said I was worried this week that $475 was the top for a few days. But yesterday it boomed at open and then dipped and I got filled. 

I was also going back and finding safer plays once a range was established and collecting $70-$80. Below my current plays and also avoiding day trades. 

I only had enough collateral for 4 trades and so I closed the earlier ones in the week and payed $2-$4 to close. (Robinhood has no commissions lolz.) because they were $30-$40 out of the money and I wanted to roll up. 

I would have no problem making a $5 spreads but I wanted to make multiple plays. 

My plan was to play till the end of this week.

IAmNotThatGood,"Like I said new and testing the water. Was a fun ride but only ending up about +40% due to the hit today. 

Incorrect. The TOTAL risk is $250. But since I got paid $100 I’m only risking $150 of my own cash. I found these strikes to be reliable on Tesla. Honesty everyone jokes about the Greeks and shit but I totally ignored them and the IV and I probably coulda convinced myself to wait if I paid more attention. I was just kinda in a routine. 

I agree. If I made several of the $70 plays I woulda been safer but in this case a $20 drop matters not. I would be screwed either way and lost more of my personal capital since the premium was lower. 

That’s why I found in my own personal calculations that $100 credit was my goal on a decent $5-$7 dip that has already happened once. Then buy a contract $7-$10 away from current price. 

Sorry confusing lingo, $.02-$.04 to roll up. Which I paid $2-$4. My Monday contracts started at $440 so the spreads got small as it went up obviously. So I was able to sacrifice 2% of my gains to make more. Until.... you know... yesterday’s sell. 

That’s correct bigger spreads closer itm have its advantages. And the more premium you collect the less person capital risk you have. That’s why I’m the money is better. But this was my first month so I was playing 70%-75% odds and a 3/5 cash risk.","<div class=""md""><p>Like I said new and testing the water.
