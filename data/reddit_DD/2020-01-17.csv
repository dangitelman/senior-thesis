Midgetfarm,"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-16/the-u-s-government-can-afford-much-more-debt

>Policy makers and voters often express concern about the level of the federal deficit, which topped $1 trillion last year, and the national debt, now more than $23 trillion. But, unlike a household that owes money to a bank, the U.S. government has the ability to tax its creditors. This power means that the federal government can afford any level of debt that is owed to American taxpayers
Suppose that the government’s debt is $100 million per person -- a huge amount that is many times larger than the current debt -- and the interest rate is 5%. How can the government begin to pay this, a figure that amounts to $5 million per person per year? It’s actually simple.   

>Suppose first that all U.S. taxpayers are exactly the same financially and so they each own the same amount of U.S. government debt. Then, the government can tell each person: your tax bill for this year and every year thereafter is equal to $5 million. People can pay this seemingly huge tax by handing over the $5 million in interest that they receive from the government.  The entire process of taxation and debt finance ends up being a complete wash.  

>Of course, not all U.S. taxpayers are the same and so they don’t own the same amount of U.S. government debt. But the government could simply announce that it is levying an annual 5% tax on all of the Treasury instruments now owned by U.S. taxpayers. That tax would generate enough money to allow the government to pay the interest that it owes. 1

>Neither of these tax plans is inflationary. Their effectiveness doesn’t depend on the federal debt being denominated in U.S. dollars. And, of course, there’s nothing special about 5% or $100 million -- the argument works for any level of debt and any interest rate. Indeed, if it wanted, the government could retire its entire debt in a similar fashion, rather than simply paying the interest.

,"2020: Party Like It’s 1999?
Excerpted from the IMA fourth quarter 2019 letter to clients.

The stock market marched higher for the year even though US companies as a whole did not become more valuable, just more expensive, as earnings failed to grow from 2018 to 2019. Earnings are estimated to be up about 5% for 2020 (though these estimates are usually revised down as the year progresses). If you look at the quality of this non-growth, then the rose-tinted glasses of the average stock market investor quickly prove inadequate. Corporate debt is up 5% in 2019, and a good chunk of the increase went into stock buybacks. As stocks become more expensive their benefit from earnings per share growth diminishes.

The US economy grew about 4% in 2019 – good news, except that our national debt grew about 5.6%, or about $1.3 trillion; our debt to GDP is over 100%; and paradoxically, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 2.6% to 1.9%. Maybe not paradoxically: The Federal Reserve went from a faint attempt of quantitative tightening (it did not even raise rates, it just talked about raising them) starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, which caused stock market to have a mini crash a year ago, to quantitative easing in the second half of 2019, which arguably caused the market to go up.","<div class=""md""><p>2020: Party Like It’s 1999?

<p>The US economy grew about 4% in 2019 – good news, except that our national debt grew about 5.6%, or about $1.3 trillion; our debt to GDP is over 100%; and paradoxically, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 2.6% to 1.9%. Maybe not paradoxically: The Federal Reserve went from a faint attempt of quantitative tightening (it did not even raise rates, it just talked about raising them) starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, which caused stock market to have a mini crash a year ago, to quantitative easing in the second half of 2019, which arguably caused the market to go up.</p>

And don&#39;t say it&#39;s good for everyone&#39;s 409k. You have to be an old ass boomer to withdraw that money. Everyone else buying in today just gets to buy at a shit PE ratio, then watch it correct and it&#39;ll take years and years for them to break even.  </p>

<p>Do you guys want to do 1999 again? Is that what you fucking want? Because that&#39;s fine, I&#39;ll keep buying puts and watching them expire, until the bubble bursts and shit falls 80% from whatever imaginary nonsense number you all ultimately decide is the top.  </p>

<p>This is salty broke ass bear, thanks for coming to my RED Talk.</p>

bandawarrior,"The smarter points for a bull run are:

1. This isn’t going parabolic, it’s more linear, so no actual frenzy/bubble

2. The fed printing money has a lag effect so cuts done and “not QE” takes more than 6 months to be felt

3. Net equity OUTFLOWS. So people have been taking money out. What “bubble” happens when people keep taking money out?

4. As long as people keep warning and there’s a sense of “this is wrong this is too high, then you aren’t in any top. When it flips to “zomg pour it all in, this isnt going down” that’s when you’re near the top.

5. There’s still the GIANT amount of money sitting on the side (look up cash on the sidelines) and the bonds managers who are uhh getting NEGATIVE returns. The retards buying those bonds will have to find yield somewhere and only game in town is the US. So that will boost things.

kross10000,">and every other car company out there is putting a lot into EV

This. The german government is right now forcing the whole german auto industry to produce EVs to lower their combined fleet carbon emissions. So Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW are investing heavily and will produce and sell a lot of EVs in the next years. China has the biggest EV industry to date and it's still pushing it with subsidies.

A lot of competition is coming for a business like Tesla which is not profitable yet. Of course, it's possible that Tesla will arise from that competition as a leader, I don't doubt that chance. Musk has really accomplished a lot.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Once the January effect is over, I can’t see us climbing much higher past these valuation levels because it’s outright ridiculous. We are actually higher than dotcom bubble valuations using Mkt cap to GDP. People are citing interest rates as a cause for this being high, but considering inflation is barely above interest rates, if we assume inflation and growth to average at 2%, it will take GDP 20 years to catch up to current valuations. P/E ratios as a measure are now distorted because of stock buy backs too, so sky high prices are is not as apparent to market participants.

WarDamn17,"I don't remember the exact timeline but it was something along the lines of:

Friday- Spent my last $200 on way otm SPY puts expiring Monday

Friday Close - Market kept going up and my puts were worth like $50

Sunday Night- Tariff Man makes his first tariff tweet and futures tanked

Monday Morning- The market opened down like 2-3% and I sold my puts for like $7000 and bought calls 

Monday Afternoon- Market rebounded a little and I sold the calls for like $16K. Rolled it all into puts expecting Tariff Man to go on another twitter rampage.
