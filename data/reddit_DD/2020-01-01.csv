xxxesus,"**THE 2018 END-OF-YEAR FAKEOUT??**

Hopefully enough of you were paying attention, to notice that in late 2018 ((November, December)) the US stock market tanked, and dragged everything down with it. I think Dow fell to All-Time-Lows like 23,000. Thanks in no small part to the Bad Orange Man tweeting ""More tariffs on China today!"" whenever he felt like it.

Then in 2019, when all that nonsense stopped and all of his lawyers were ending up in jail, the markets finally recovered, making it look like the year had 15 percent gains.

BUT THOSE GAINS are just what was lost last Christmas!!

xxxesus,"**THE 2018 END-OF-YEAR FAKEOUT??**

Hopefully enough of you were paying attention, to notice that in late 2018 ((November, December)) the US stock market tanked, and dragged everything down with it. I think Dow fell to All-Time-Lows like 23,000. Thanks in no small part to the Bad Orange Man tweeting ""More tariffs on China today!"" whenever he felt like it.

Then in 2019, when all that nonsense stopped and all of his lawyers were ending up in jail, the markets finally recovered, making it look like the year had 15 percent gains.

BUT THOSE GAINS are just what was lost last Christmas!!
