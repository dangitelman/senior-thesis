Gain of 9.51% in 60 trading sessions = 0.0155% gain per trading day. The fed has repo going on until february.

331.95 with a gain of 3.78% gives 344.5.

sankalp89,"Help me out in this AMD situation!!  

My position summary-
Long $20 Jan 15 2021 AMD Calls
Short $40 Jan 15 2021 AMD Calls

Back in April 2019, I figured that AMD options sell at very nice juicy premiums and AMD is also among the top ten most traded Options vehicle most of the time. I formed a bullish forecast on AMD when it appeared that it'll outsmart Intel in the nanometer race. That was when I decided to enter AMD. 

I opened five LEAP contracts for Jan 15 2021 expiration at an average of $1400 per contract. At the time AMD was trading at about $27 and it traded in a channel of $27-33 for several months. I made about $2500 (or about $500 per contract) just by selling premium on weekly calls. 

My problem started in October when AMD started picking up wildly. In just a matter of 90 days, it went up from $28 to $51. I didn't want to let go of my AMD long position, so I kept rolling out my short calls in time to avoid risk of being called away. I reached at a point that my Poor Man's Covered Call converted into a Vertical Spread for Jan 2021 expiration. My spread is long 20 - short 40 C. I can't roll any further. At this moment, the whole spread is selling for $1500. And at the time of expiration, the entire extrinsic value of the short option will collapse and it'll be selling at the width of the strikes or $2000.   


My question is - What should I do in this case if I want to hang on to AMD since my forecast for AMD is that it'll go further up from here?

Since there is very tiny extrinsic left in my long call, I'm thinking of exercising my long call @ 20 per share and use them as collateral instead. What this will get me? I will be able to roll my short call further than just Jan 2021.","<div class=""md""><p>Help me out in this AMD situation!!  </p>

sleepyfries,"So I decided I'm doing DIS calls.

If I had a family and kids, I would have DIS. Netflix content is pure shit. And they're still doing the stupid autoplay preview bullshit. I fucking hate it. And why cant i click on a section name and see all the movies? Why the fuck do I have to scroll horizontally?

Nflx is just trash. They need to fire their UX team and content management team. All of them. Burn them.

DIS will dominate children's market. Like they do with cruises, they'll do with tv. And they sprinkle enough adult shows in to keep us entertained.

<p>I want you to be aware of how we are being set up.</p>

<p>Does the Patriot Act ring a bell?</p>

<p>Does the National Defense Authorization Act ring a bell?</p>

<p>If people show up wearing any kind of uniform, patch or other symbol on their clothing signifying they belong to a militia and something goes wrong, you could/will be held as a domestic terrorist.</p>

<p>If anyone steps out of line, all it takes is one person, it may even be a government plant....if that plant does anything to disrupt the rally, you could/will be arrested as a domestic terrorist.</p>

<p>The Governor, using the media has already set the stage for this to happen.
He has already laid the groundwork to make the entire movement look like insurrection.</p>

<p>It will be used to put the rest of the nation on notice of what will happen to you, if you resist.</p>

<p>They have used the Southern Poverty Law Center over the last 15 years to lay the groundwork.</p>

<p>They have labeled us as potential domestic terrorist for a long time now.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever related to the 3%er&#39;s, a militia, or just belonged to any Patriot group...the groundwork has been laid to brand you as a domestic terrorist.</p>

<p>They have gone out of their way since the Obama years to insure they had us labeled, but it didn&#39;t start with Obama. It started with the Patriot Act under the Bush administration.</p>

<p>We are being played by a well oiled machine, these things have been in the works for many years.</p>

<p>They are kicking things into high gear. Military veterans were/are even listed as potential domestic terrorist.</p>

<p>We were told not once, but several times by the current President, “It&#39;s Not Me they are after, It&#39;s You, The American People.“</p>

<p>Their actions over the last three years have shown you he was right, they are coming after us full speed ahead and they aren&#39;t even trying to hide it anymore.</p>

<p>Sic semper tyrannis, keep your head on a swivel and know what&#39;s going on around you at all times, at Lobby Day 1/20/20.</p>

<p>Everyone be safe out there....Thus always to tyrants.</p>

Might go up another 10 or 20 bucks.The comp for last year is easy and i think institutions are ok holding it here into earnings plus it’s in the QQQ index with a pretty good weighting and the Qs are just gonna keep getting bought. The stock is way more liquid now than it was last year so i think you will see strong buying without much selling going into the number and that could create a real momentum chase not that unlike Tesla. The stock just reached its all time high it set in the .com era and look what tesla did after doing that.

xesus2019,"



What is the difference between a ""wirehouse"" and a ""private bank"" ---- just whether you have $1MM ? 

=== ===== 


I'm having a hard time figuring out who is in charge at Wells Fargo's ""Wealth and Investment Management division"". They seem to be shuffling people around like a frenetic game of musical chairs.

There was a guy named Jay Welker, but he somehow got MeToo'd into retirement because some women complained. Then there was a guy named Dean Junkans, but he, too, retired.

That left us with David Kowach, running ""WELLS FARGO ADVISORS"" with 1.6T or 1.9T in AUM. But then I hear that he is also gone, moved over to ""community banking"" instead and leaving a guy named JIM HAYS in charge. To top it all off there are CIO types named Erik Davidson and Jonathan Weiss, and god only knows what they do.

Can someone provide me with an up-to-date Org Chart for those guys? And also while you're at it, esplain to me the difference between a ""wirehouse"" and a private bank.

OK, thanks.","<div class=""md""><p>What is the difference between a &quot;wirehouse&quot; and a &quot;private bank&quot; ---- just whether you have $1MM ? </p>

cscqb4,"Dude I once got convinced by a friend to eat a full stem (the none cap part) of a shroom telling me that it won't hit and all I might feel is ""a little higher than you currently are"" as I was doing some heavy weed too.

About 45 mins later I started internally freaking out, and even though I was calm and quiet on the outside I had the urge to get back to my place from his. I went out and started walking towards my place (usually a 15-20 min walk) and then it FUCKING hit me. It was a dark rainy day and I honestly felt like a U.S. marine patrolling and on the verge of getting ambushed by an army of Vietcong in the woods.

I finally got back into my place in one piece after what felt like the most traumatic walk of my life. Got in bed to try and sleep it off but kept feeling like somebody was watching me. I was living at an apartment close to street level and each time the light of a car driving by got through my blinds I thought that I was getting a spotlight shined on me by a police helicopter or some shit.

Took me a very long time to sleep and the next day at work I was quiet as the crypt still thinking about what the fuck transpired the night before. 2/10 experience would do again.","<div class=""md""><p>Dude I once got convinced by a friend to eat a full stem (the none cap part) of a shroom telling me that it won&#39;t hit and all I might feel is &quot;a little higher than you currently are&quot; as I was doing some heavy weed too.</p>

**UHNIs: A Lot of Money In A Few Hands**

The biggest reason that makes targeting ultra high net-worth individuals (UHNIs) worthwhile is, well, the fact that there is a lot of money to manage with fewer people to target. Wells Fargo estimates that the U.S. has roughly 10,000 households with $50 million or more in investable assets. Among them, these families control more than $1 trillion.

**Of Course There Is A Catch !**

But the same reason makes this an extremely difficult market to expand in. Like everything else about the ultra rich, their financial needs are also markedly different from those offered to the public at large. To make things worse, needs are extremely diverse among the group itself.

Abbot Donning claims to have a plan though. Wells Fargo insists that the new brand is a ‘one-stop shop’ for everything that the ultra rich individuals and families will ever need – something it illustrates from the fact that Abbot Donning encompasses an asset management division, a private banking channel, a combined trust and fiduciary service, and *even a group that addresses family psychology and governance.*","<div class=""md""><p><a href=""/u/stormwillpass"">/u/stormwillpass</a> </p>

CreditSpreadz,"Nio is a variable-interest entity, or VIE, a structure created in the 1990s as a workaround for Chinese companies that are not allowed to have direct foreign ownership.

Under the VIE structure, the Chinese company creates two entities, one in China that holds the permits and licenses needed to do business there and the other an offshore entity, in this case in the Cayman Islands, in which foreign investors can buy shares. The Chinese entity, which is usually owned by top executives, pays fees and royalties to the offshore company in contractual arrangements.

Basically it's like Tencent.

Here's what you do based on what continent your shitty country is in

Europe - Watch Taken, do everything they do except don't piss of Liam Neeson

South America - Two options, 1 - Become drug kingpin. 2 - get poor retards to give you money to smuggle them to America then just leave them once you get to Mexico.

East Asia - Only one option - Become a respected leader in your community and obtain power in your local government, then become boys with The Communist Party of China and sell your people and land to them.

Middle East - Start a new kind of ISIS that is geared towards the modern muslim millennial, instead of attacking the west with bombs, you just have your followers complain on social media that things aren't fair. 

Africa - Easiest one, steal kids from other villages, make them shoot their parents and then you become rich.","<div class=""md""><p>Dude, you&#39;re lucky enough to live in a shithole 3rd world country and your bitching about not having Robinhood?</p>

=== ===== ======

For almost two years, Wells Fargo has been under near-constant fire. It all began, of course, with the revelation that employees in bank branches, who faced immense pressure to sell, had opened fake accounts for customers. Then, the bank agreed to pay a $1 billion fine to settle allegations of abuses in its auto lending and mortgage businesses.

In the spring, the bank also disclosed that its board was conducting a review of “certain activities” within the bank’s wealth management unit, which filings describe as including fee calculations of fiduciary accounts.

In mid-July, Yahoo Finance reported on increasing sales pressure in the wealth management sector of Wells’s Private Bank. Late last month, the Wall Street Journal also reported that four Wells Fargo advisors had sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, detailing “long-standing problems” in the wealth management business.

Now, former advisors in the wealth management area of the Private Bank, which caters to high-net-worth investors, are shedding light on what some of those problems may be. They expressed additional concerns to Yahoo Finance, including Wells encouraging fiduciary advisors to put client money in higher-fee options, requiring advisors to, in effect, cross-sell products like mortgages and financial planning, and push what several former advisors viewed as unnecessary financial planning fees on clients. Internal documents shared with Yahoo Finance corroborate their concerns.

In addition, the Journal reported that the broad class of Wells Fargo advisors were encouraged to funnel wealthier clients into the Private Bank’s wealth management area because the fees were higher. A former senior executive in this area and multiple former Wells Fargo brokers expressed that to Yahoo Finance as well.

In general, Wells Fargo’s interest in boosting its advisory revenue is in step with much of the industry. In the low-interest environment of the past decade, most banks have looked for other ways to bring in revenue, and wealth management products were an obvious choice for expansion. But at Wells Fargo, a number of troubling reports have emerged that cast a less-than-flattering light on this expansion.

“At Wells Fargo Wealth and Investment Management, we are committed to taking care of our clients’ financial needs every day and take seriously our responsibility to help them preserve and invest their hard-earned savings,” says spokesperson Shea Leordeanu. “Our primary goal is to be a trusted advisor to our clients and to act in their best interest.”
Advisors felt pushed to add high-fee products to portfolios

Wells Fargo encouraged its advisors to put their clients’ money in a variety of more complex products, from so-called alternative investments — such as hedge funds or private equity funds — to separately managed accounts, which are portfolios of individual securities. Advisors were also encouraged to use financial tools like options. Some of these came with additional fees.

Such products can be in clients’ best interests. But because advisors say they were encouraged to reach certain quotas for all these products or face hits to their compensation, it raises a question as to whether these fiduciary advisors were serving their clients’ interests — or their own. Fiduciaries must put the interests of the client first.

In a presentation document called “IFS Summit: Be The Solution,” from August 2016, Private Bank advisors were told to have “At least 4 private placement purchases per Investment Strategist,” “at least 3 new third party SMA [separately managed accounts] per Investment Strategist,” and “At least 20% of accounts with $500,000 or more in equity value have OSG [options strategies group] officer assigned.”

The “strategy” that troubled one former advisor most was for options, which carried some of the highest fees. Advisors were obligated to have an “options strategy officer” for 20% of accounts that had over $500,000 worth of equities, according to the documents and former advisors.

According to fee schedules, fees for options — managed collars, long calls, call and put spreads, and non-single-stock call writing — carried additional fees of 0.50%, based on the assets involved with these strategies. These fees were “easily half or even two-thirds of the normal asset management fee for an account,” said a former advisor.

Another former senior Wells Fargo strategist points out that an options strategy can make sense. For instance, if someone owns a significant amount of stock in one company, he or she may want to protect against a decline in that stock. “My problem was with the quota,” he says, because it encouraged advisors to implement an options strategy even when it didn’t make sense.

The alternative investments requirement looked to several advisors like it presented potential conflicts of interest, because it could result in additional revenue for the bank. According to Wells Fargo’s consent form, which it gave to clients to sign off on these investments, the bank may “receive compensation” that is “in addition to the fees that Wells Fargo receives for performing fiduciary services for your Account.”

The consent form acknowledges the conflict of interest potential directly: “Because of the compensation received by our affiliates in connection with the Fund, Wells Fargo’s investment of the Account in the Fund may be considered a conflict of interest.”

Wells Fargo says that in the majority of cases, rebates are passed down to clients.

“When fund managers provide a rebate of fund fees, Wells Fargo deposits the full rebate for our clients’ benefit,” says Leordeanu. “For a small number of certain funds, Wells Fargo may be compensated for services provided to the funds, as disclosed to and consented by clients prior to investment.”

With separately managed accounts, where the goal was “at least three new third party” accounts per advisor for 2016, there were also additional fees. Separately managed accounts carried expenses of 0.30-0.80% for equity strategies, according to various fee schedules.

“As part of our asset allocation strategy, we offer a variety of services to meet our clients’ financial needs and objectives in a properly risk adjusted portfolio and we have supervisory processes and controls in place,” says Erik Davidson, the chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Wealth Management. “Access to Private Placement investments, Separately Managed Accounts, and Options Strategies are among many of the benefits of being a client of Wells Fargo Private Bank. Wells Fargo investment professionals have a strong understanding of these investment solutions, which are intended to improve the risk-adjusted return outcomes of high net worth investors’ portfolios. We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that all of our Private Bank clients are informed and educated about the investment solutions that may be appropriate for their individual circumstances.”

In addition to extra fees and expenses for options, numerous fee schedules Yahoo Finance reviewed disclosed that the bank may charge brokerage commissions on top of the annual fee clients paid for portfolio management. Former advisors told Yahoo Finance that clients frequently complained about these additional fees. Most clients who pay an annual fee do not also pay trading commissions.

Yahoo Finance reviewed five client statements in which both commissions and assets-under-management–based fees were charged. The commissions added around single-digit basis points (between 0.04% and 0.09%) to the total amount the clients were paying, a former advisor said. Another former advisor said commissions could add up to 0.25% if there was 30% turnover of securities in a portfolio.

These fees were not kept by Wells Fargo; they were simply expenses for trading and research. However the norm for competitors of Wells Fargo’s Private Bank is to include commissions or trading expenses in the asset-based fee, according to sources across the financial industry with knowledge of the matter. Charging clients separately for the two types of fees would allow a bank to show clients a potentially lower and more competitive annual-fee figure against another bank’s commission-included fee.
Advisors faced pressure that could put client interests second","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

But because advisors say they were encouraged to reach certain quotas for all these products or face hits to their compensation, it raises a question as to whether these fiduciary advisors were serving their clients’ interests — or their own. Fiduciaries must put the interests of the client first.</p>

<p>In a presentation document called “IFS Summit: Be The Solution,” from August 2016, Private Bank advisors were told to have “At least 4 private placement purchases per Investment Strategist,” “at least 3 new third party SMA [separately managed accounts] per Investment Strategist,” and “At least 20% of accounts with $500,000 or more in equity value have OSG [options strategies group] officer assigned.”</p>

<p>The “strategy” that troubled one former advisor most was for options, which carried some of the highest fees. Advisors were obligated to have an “options strategy officer” for 20% of accounts that had over $500,000 worth of equities, according to the documents and former advisors.</p>

<p>According to fee schedules, fees for options — managed collars, long calls, call and put spreads, and non-single-stock call writing — carried additional fees of 0.50%, based on the assets involved with these strategies. These fees were “easily half or even two-thirds of the normal asset management fee for an account,” said a former advisor.</p>

<p>Another former senior Wells Fargo strategist points out that an options strategy can make sense. For instance, if someone owns a significant amount of stock in one company, he or she may want to protect against a decline in that stock. “My problem was with the quota,” he says, because it encouraged advisors to implement an options strategy even when it didn’t make sense.</p>

<p>The alternative investments requirement looked to several advisors like it presented potential conflicts of interest, because it could result in additional revenue for the bank. According to Wells Fargo’s consent form, which it gave to clients to sign off on these investments, the bank may “receive compensation” that is “in addition to the fees that Wells Fargo receives for performing fiduciary services for your Account.”</p>

<p>The consent form acknowledges the conflict of interest potential directly: “Because of the compensation received by our affiliates in connection with the Fund, Wells Fargo’s investment of the Account in the Fund may be considered a conflict of interest.”</p>

<p>Wells Fargo says that in the majority of cases, rebates are passed down to clients.</p>

<p>“When fund managers provide a rebate of fund fees, Wells Fargo deposits the full rebate for our clients’ benefit,” says Leordeanu. “For a small number of certain funds, Wells Fargo may be compensated for services provided to the funds, as disclosed to and consented by clients prior to investment.”</p>

<p>With separately managed accounts, where the goal was “at least three new third party” accounts per advisor for 2016, there were also additional fees. Separately managed accounts carried expenses of 0.30-0.80% for equity strategies, according to various fee schedules.</p>

<p>“As part of our asset allocation strategy, we offer a variety of services to meet our clients’ financial needs and objectives in a properly risk adjusted portfolio and we have supervisory processes and controls in place,” says Erik Davidson, the chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Wealth Management. “Access to Private Placement investments, Separately Managed Accounts, and Options Strategies are among many of the benefits of being a client of Wells Fargo Private Bank. Wells Fargo investment professionals have a strong understanding of these investment solutions, which are intended to improve the risk-adjusted return outcomes of high net worth investors’ portfolios. We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that all of our Private Bank clients are informed and educated about the investment solutions that may be appropriate for their individual circumstances.”</p>

<p>In addition to extra fees and expenses for options, numerous fee schedules Yahoo Finance reviewed disclosed that the bank may charge brokerage commissions on top of the annual fee clients paid for portfolio management. Former advisors told Yahoo Finance that clients frequently complained about these additional fees. Most clients who pay an annual fee do not also pay trading commissions.</p>

<p>Yahoo Finance reviewed five client statements in which both commissions and assets-under-management–based fees were charged. The commissions added around single-digit basis points (between 0.04% and 0.09%) to the total amount the clients were paying, a former advisor said. Another former advisor said commissions could add up to 0.25% if there was 30% turnover of securities in a portfolio.</p>

<p>These fees were not kept by Wells Fargo; they were simply expenses for trading and research. However the norm for competitors of Wells Fargo’s Private Bank is to include commissions or trading expenses in the asset-based fee, according to sources across the financial industry with knowledge of the matter. Charging clients separately for the two types of fees would allow a bank to show clients a potentially lower and more competitive annual-fee figure against another bank’s commission-included fee.
Advisors faced pressure that could put client interests second</p>

artichoke2me,"Yes exactly started the week coming off of some gains from MSFT, SPY, Apple. Bought TSM calls for 17th, BAC calls for 17th and BYND.

Monday woke up to a nice gain with BYND. Decided to yolo on BYND. Sold everything and rolled over my BYND calls. Tuesday morning I wake up to a 12k gains. I decide to wait and ride BYND to the moon 🌙. 

Ended up closing the day with 24dollar profit from 12k cuz I decided to hold and buy more calls. 

Thought BYND was going to make a come back. Tesla of food. Nope Bernstein analyst downgrade BYND and the rest is history. Sold calls that were worth 2 thousand dollars each for 242 dollars. 

It’s the mentality I already excelled in school where it was all or nothing mentality. Either I make the “A” or I am a loser. Never learned how to be just satisfied with little gains. 

I need to build up capital and I’ll come back 💪 than ever.

madmax_br5,"Butterfly and condor is pretty similar, butterfly is just narrower but deeper loss potential but higher profit potential as well. Downside compared to a single spread is that the max profit potential is less but that’s because you’re playing both sides. It’s basically a bull and bear spread centered on the same strike. 

In fact you can augment a butterfly with a slightly OTM spread On either side to boost max profits without much added loss potential. For example consider a stock trading at 100. Let’s say you buy an ATM butterfly by selling 10x each 99 and 101 puts and buying 20x 100 puts. This gives you equal earnings so long as the trade expires and the price is either higher than 101 or lower than 99, and your max loss is if it closes at 100 exactly. But you think this stock will probably continue a bullish momentum, so you can buy an additional debit spread at 101/102 which will increase your payoff a lot on the bullish side of the trade, and only marginally increase your loss potential. Model an ATM butterfly with an additional debit spread to either side on a low volatility stock like AAPL and you’ll see what I mean","<div class=""md""><p>Butterfly and condor is pretty similar, butterfly is just narrower but deeper loss potential but higher profit potential as well.

<p>The industry needs to consolate which means many of the current weed companies will fold under. No real telling at this point who will survive to be the industry leader. Who knows if it&#39;s legalized federally a non weed company like Altria with lots of capital might shift to seize much of the market share.</p>

xesus2019,"If advisors didn’t meet goals of certain amounts of options, separately managed accounts, and private placement alternatives in their book of clients, their bonuses were penalized, according to advisors and documents.

Performance review documents reviewed by Yahoo Finance showed advisors being evaluated on their “investment execution,” which was based on utilizing alternatives, options, and private placements, and praised for using options in client portfolios because it was a “significant driver of revenue.”

“All of a sudden if you’re not doing so many separately managed accounts, your bonus was reduced,” one advisor recalls.

There was also a direct link between compensation and the overall fees an advisor generated. According to the “2017 WM Compensation Plan,” 25% of “incentive compensation plan managerial business objectives” or ICP MBO — which was internal language for sales goals — was based on fee revenue.

This could put advisors in tough situations, the advisor recalled, when they would be faced with the dilemma of putting a client in an investment that may not have been the best choice for them or risk their bonus.

“In all the different parts of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses — whether retail brokerage, trust, wealth or retirement — our team members are focused on our clients and their unique financial needs,” Leordeanu says. “While different types of accounts have different fees, all fees are fully disclosed. We are committed to transparency as we work with our clients to help them realize their financial goals.”

Indeed, Wells Fargo did not hide any of the fees. They were present in consent forms and fee schedules. However, clients were not given the “internal use only” documents demonstrating advisors’ incentives for their bonuses.

In some cases, clients were also not explicitly informed when additional fees present on the various fee schedules were activated. According to two former advisors at the Private Bank, many accounts were discretionarily managed, meaning client approval wasn’t required for each move.

“Where the managers went first was in the irrevocable trust, where Wells Fargo was trustee, where they can decide what to do,” one said. “That’s where all these strategies went first, and lots of them. Fees on fees.”

For advisors trying to meet a quota but lacking enough clients they felt could benefit from SMAs, irrevocable trusts were the easiest way to meet it.

Another advisor discussing the irrevocable trust fee schedule recalled hearing a manager say, “So long as you disclose it, you can charge it!”
Advisors were expected to sell

In addition to the use of advanced investing options, Wells Fargo advisors in the Private Bank were also required to generate other business in the form of loans, mortgages, and wealth-planning products, or, once again, put their bonuses in jeopardy.

According to former advisors and internal documents, those “ICP MBOs” were also tied to getting clients to deepen their connections with Wells Fargo.

Advisors were required to have “full outside line of business participation,” which meant that an advisor was obligated to bring on other Wells Fargo employees from other divisions like banking, brokerage, or planning. Since bonuses depended on this, advisors were incentivized to use such services whether the client needed it or not.

“Comp drives behavior,” said one former advisor. Performance review documents for advisors in the private bank show “execution of the Tactical Sales Process” as an area of evaluation.

Wells Fargo advisors were also incentivized to pitch other Wells Fargo products themselves, according to 2016 compensation plan documents for Private Bank advisors. For referring clients to mortgages, lines of credit, loans, and estate fees, advisors would receive fee credit that counted towards bonuses.

“Acknowledge the important support that Advisors provide on larger, more complex portfolio mortgages that are not sourced by an Advisor,” reads a document called “2017 WM Compensation Plan. “[This] is consistent with Wealth Management’s philosophy of rewarding sales and sourcing activity.”

This, the advisors said, was not always in the best interests of the client, something that conflicted with their responsibility as fee-compensated fiduciaries.

“You had to do so many mortgages. Two or three mortgage referrals every year — one or two had to stick,” the advisor said. “It only behooves us to find solutions, and you might as well find solutions in-house. But when it becomes your job to find those you neglect what your clients need.”
Turning to planning

Wells Fargo advisors were also instructed to get clients to do “Client Discovery Reviews,” or CDRs in Wells lingo. These were reviews conducted with clients that highlighted areas in which a client could use additional products or services. One former executive defends CDRs as a helpful tool, but others viewed them as a thinly veiled sales push.

According to internal presentation documents from the “Wealth Regional Development Conference 2015,” CDRs were introduced as a criteria for advisors’ bonuses that year.

“We show you CDR/Planning and Full Participation [as ‘key measurables’] because even the discretionary award criteria has an expectation around these,” the presentation documents read. Other internal documents, such as performance reviews, highlight “planning penetration” and “client discovery review” as “critical business metrics.”

While the CDR was free, it also opened the door to selling a client on a full financial plan, which was not free, or additional products. The fees for planning, according to an internal presentation called “The Wealth Planning Client Experience,” were significant: from $5,000 to $68,000 per year, depending on the client’s assets. The CDR “was the gatewayfor pitching the Planning Engagement,” said a former advisor. “It would also be used to tell the client they didn’t have enough life insurance or that maybe an annuity would be a good idea based on the need for more income in retirement.”

Advisors were also told they “should include a Planner” for client portfolios over $5 million, according to that internal presentation.

Wells Fargo’s motivation to increase CDRs and planning is made clear in the same document, which notes that the use of these tools results in “Deeper Cross-Sell” and “151% more revenue.”

“The Planners strive to convert each client into signing a planning engagement for 12 months during which they find other areas the client may have gaps where a product can be sold,” said one former advisor.

Three of the former Wells Fargo employees interviewed complained about the ethics of the planning engagement and a culture of pushing these planning solutions on clients. In one instance, a former employee recalled that before a sales meeting with a prospect, he said a proposed plan wasn’t in the best interest of a client. He was left off the call. A former colleague confirmed that this employee was eventually penalized for not selling enough.

“It was a very strong sales culture,” he said. “It was mostly growing your book of business. Get more assets under management. Write more loans.”

Another noted that advanced planning was only really necessary for clients with over $11 million, because of complexities of the estate tax.

Even as Wells Fargo’s public image took a beating, advisors were still being asked to look for opportunities to expand planning. On the day former CEO John Stumpf appeared in front of the Senate Banking Committee to answer for the bank’s retail banking sins, the then–senior director of sales Susan Mayo and senior director of planning Amy Theisen emailed the advisors to “reach out to every client in your book” to look for CDR opportunities.

“This is a great opportunity to highlight to your clients … that we lead with Discovery,” she wrote.

Of course, it made sense for Wells advisors to find a way to touch base with clients at such a precarious time. But one former advisor was horrified by the email, because he viewed it as a “thinly veiled sales push for the planning process — something that sounds good on paper as part of a client experience, but was nothing more than a tool to increase revenue on every client.” Indeed, if Wells truly wanted to change — and not just to advertise that it has changed — transparency about the ways employees are paid might be a way to start.","<div class=""md""><p>If advisors didn’t meet goals of certain amounts of options, separately managed accounts, and private placement alternatives in their book of clients, their bonuses were penalized, according to advisors and documents.</p>

xesus2019,"Warren Buffett's track record as an investor and CEO is unmatched. In his 54 years running Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), thousands of people have become millionaires by buying shares and then sitting on their hands while he turned the former textile manufacturer into one of the most-profitable holding companies on Earth. As of this writing, Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries that earn tens of billions of dollars a year, and has a market capitalization of nearly $560 billion. 

Yet Buffett is best known for his skill as a great stock picker, and deservedly so. A massive portion of Berkshire's market value is derived from its roughly $215 billion stock portfolio. One of Berkshire's biggest holdings is Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC): The 378 million shares it owned at the end of last quarter is worth $19.8 billion at recent prices.


===== ======


So how much money has the Oracle of Omaha made for himself and Berkshire investors on Wells Fargo? It depends on what you're measuring; on a cost basis, Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake has roughly doubled in value, netting about $11 billion in unrealized gains. However, that doesn't tell the entire story, including how much value Wells delivers to Berkshire's coffers in the form of its generous dividend.","<div class=""md""><p>Warren Buffett&#39;s track record as an investor and CEO is unmatched.

**How much Buffett paid, and what it's worth now**

While we don't know from day to day how many shares of Wells Fargo Berkshire Hathaway owns, we do get an update each quarter, when it files its Form 13F with the SEC, listing its stock holdings. As of the end of September, Berkshire owned 378,369,018 shares of Wells. At recent prices of around $52 per share, that stake is worth $19.8 billion. 

Getting to Berkshire's cost basis is a little bit trickier. The company doesn't include the cost basis of its stock portfolio holdings in its quarterly filings, and that data is not broken out in the 13F either. However, in Buffett's annual letter to shareholders -- a highly recommended read every year -- does include the cost basis for Wells, along with that of Berkshire's other biggest holdings.

Last year's letter -- the new one will arrive in the next couple of months -- showed a cost basis of $10.639 billion on Berkshire's stake in Wells Fargo. However, that value was on 449,349,102 Wells Fargo shares. To keep its stake in Wells below 10% (a regulatory requirement for investing in banks), Berkshire sold off nearly 71 million Wells shares in 2019, to stay ahead of Wells' own aggressive share-repurchase policy. 

If we remove those 71 million shares -- at a cost basis of about $23.68 per share, according to Buffett's letter -- from the equation, then we arrive at a rough cost of $8.96 billion for Berkshire's current stake, which is worth $19.8 billion. So that's about $10.8 billion in unrealized gains on the investment as of the end of the third quarter.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>How much Buffett paid, and what it&#39;s worth now</strong></p>

If you want decent premium on a weekly option the strike is going to be basically just one or two ticks above the current price.

xesus2019,"**Here's how much Wells Fargo pays Berkshire in dividends**

Considering all the turmoil Wells Fargo has gone through in recent years, particularly the ""fake accounts"" scandal that still has the bank under SEC sanctions that limit its growth, many investors have been surprised Buffett hasn't sold off Berkshire's stake in it and moved on. 

However, that knee-jerk reaction ignores the fact that Wells continues to generate substantial profits and strong returns, as well as what may be the biggest reason Berkshire should hold on to the bank's stock long term: its dividend. 

In 2019, Wells Fargo raised its quarterly payout to $0.51 per share. That works out to $2.04 per year at the current rate. Based on the 378.4 million shares it held at last count, Wells Fargo will send Berkshire $771.9 million in dividends in 2020. 

Taking it a step further, Wells' track record of dividend growth has rewarded Berkshire -- and every other long-term Wells Fargo shareholder -- quite well for just holding. Since the beginning of 2014, Wells has increased its payout by 70%. For Berkshire, that means it has seen the dividends it earns on those 378.4 million shares grow from $454 million in 2013 to more than three-quarters of a billion dollars this year. 

To put it another way, that means Berkshire earns about 8.6% in yield on the $9 billion it paid for its stake in Wells, just on from the dividend. That's an incredibly high rate of return all by itself.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>Here&#39;s how much Wells Fargo pays Berkshire in dividends</strong></p>

xesus2019,"**An excellent case study in wealth creation**

Buffett has long sung the praises of the ""buy high-quality companies, hold them for a very long time"" strategy, and Wells Fargo proves that out quite well. While plenty of investors may look at a stock in their portfolio that's doubled in value and sell to ""take money off the table,"" Buffett continually demonstrates that the best businesses will continue helping investors build wealth if they simply hold on.

Sure, Buffett could sell and realize $11 billion in profits; but he'd lose almost $800 million in yearly cash flows by doing that, not to mention creating a $2.3 billion federal tax bill on those gains. 

So before you sell your next stock just because it's made major share price gains, consider the long-term implications, and whether you'd be better off just sitting on your hands and letting that great business continue being great -- and growing your wealth. Buffett is undoubtedly a master, but some of his best ""secrets"" are simple actions any investor can replicate, like not selling your best investments just because they've gone up in value.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>An excellent case study in wealth creation</strong></p>
