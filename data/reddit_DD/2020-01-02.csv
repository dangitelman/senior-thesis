TimAppleBurner,"I legit think this. 

One of the biggest catalysts for the 2008 recession was lending markets freezing up. Money markets dried up, banks were afraid to lend, and many of them had poor liquidity. When everyone was afraid to lend money, things crashed quickly. In an ordinary time, if a bank failed, the market could fairly easily absorb that failure and life kind of goes on. But every financial institution had those credit default swaps. So they wanted to keep as much cash on hand for their eventually foreseen demise. There is plenty of other things to it, I’m oversimplifying and highlighting the cash liquidity crisis of  2008-2009. 

Fast forward to September, the Fed noticed a severe spike in the mid-tier interest rate break through the upper high end interest rate, and lender markets froze overnight. The Fed saw this and coupled with the yield curve inversion earlier this year, they knew it was time to do something. So they’ve basically guaranteed the dealers to be filled to the brim with cash to lend money to keep the economy in the 8000rpm range. And at least so far since September, I’d say it’s worked. Truth be told what will happen once they technically sai they would stop on the 13th of January, but for now its working.","<div class=""md""><p>I legit think this. </p>

vortex30,"Most companies P/E is atrocious, so nat bad in comparison is still bad.

This market is fucked and it won't end well. But bulls can rejoice until the massive great depression 2.0 or Venezuelan hyper inflation hits globally.

And it could easily be 3 years or more before we see those things unfold.

I feel like not letting a great depression happen in 2008 bought us like 12 - 20 more years of good times, anemic growth and depressed wages, but hey, look how rich the rich are! and then soon, we'll see 10 years of utter collapse which could cause a massive crisis, deaths of billions and suffering for all, if logistics break down. Nationalism and racism and extremism will run rampent in this environment. Somewhere a Hitler will arise, this time he has nukes though. 

When we could have just seen a 75% instead of 55% drawdown in S&P in 2008/2009, then maybe low returns up to 2013 or so, at which time we'd have set ourselves up beautifully for another 80 year secular bull market, a full deflated housing market which by now all millennials would own homes instead of rich Chinese billionaires buying up our properties and homes being completely unaffordable. 

But nah, they chose the short term rewards way out, and we're all going to pay dearly for it.. Just not today... Not today...","<div class=""md""><p>Most companies P/E is atrocious, so nat bad in comparison is still bad.</p>
