Fortunately I have 50k / year job still and very few expenses now ($300 / month rent to mum, car lease, car insurance, drug addiction) so I can always crawl outta this hole but feeling like a big gay bear loser now. Thought uvxy calls were free money a week ago. Nasdaq starting selling off, looked great, but spy barely followed. Was up $4k at one point but missed my chance to sell thought for sure we were at start of something bigger. I have til next Friday but they're $37 calls and have a cost of $2ish I believe, soooo I need something like a pandemic depression to save me now. Oh wait...

Fucking market is being constantly manipulated and I'm too stupid to realize that hyperinflation is the goal here. Actually thought they may care to preserve the currency in this but nah, we're just gonna fake a recovery and make a real nasty situation worse.","<div class=""md""><p>Welp this gay bear is in danger, good thing I already am rid of my apartment and back at mum&#39;s place or I&#39;d really be eating shit right now.

The United States Commerce Department announced on Monday it imposed sanctions on 11 Chinese companies over their role in the alleged human rights violations in the Xinjiang autonomous region.

""Beijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,"" US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated. ""This action will ensure that our goods and technologies are not used in the Chinese Communist Party’s despicable offensive against defenseless Muslim minority populations,"" he added.

The companies added to the Entity List due to their practice of forced labor involving Muslim minorities include Changji Esquel Textile Co. Ltd., Nanchang O-Film Tech, Hefei Meiling Co. Ltd. and Nanchang O-Film Tech. Meanwhile, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI were sanctioned over allegedly conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Muslims.

<p>The United States Commerce Department announced on Monday it imposed sanctions on 11 Chinese companies over their role in the alleged human rights violations in the Xinjiang autonomous region.</p>

<p>&quot;Beijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,&quot; US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated. &quot;This action will ensure that our goods and technologies are not used in the Chinese Communist Party’s despicable offensive against defenseless Muslim minority populations,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>The companies added to the Entity List due to their practice of forced labor involving Muslim minorities include Changji Esquel Textile Co. Ltd., Nanchang O-Film Tech, Hefei Meiling Co. Ltd. and Nanchang O-Film Tech. Meanwhile, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI were sanctioned over allegedly conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Muslims.</p>

<p>Bet safely!</p>

GreyArea23,"> This week will provide a litmus test on just how bullish investors are on inflation’s upward trajectory when the government sells $14 billion in 10-year TIPS, as the inflation-linked debt is dubbed, on Thursday. There won’t be fresh insights on Fed policy because officials are in a blackout period for public speeches ahead of their July 28-29 meeting. Traders will be keenly watching the latest read on unemployment claims and a first read of U.S. manufacturing in July.
